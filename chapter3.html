        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          In the previous chapter, we have seen the methods of argument construction and the ways by which we can evaluate arguments. Any good argument must be presented by clear, accurate and understandable language. Correct reasoning can only be conveyed through language. The clarification and analysis of terms and statements is the objective of philosophy in general and logic in particular.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          In order to interpret, analyze, and evaluate arguments well, one must pay close attention to language. Many errors in logic stem from a careless or imprecise use of language, and many misunderstandings about the nature of language. Hence, logic requires proper use of terms and statements. Therefore, in this chapter we will study about the purposes of language, meaning and definitions of terms and different techniques of definitions of terms. We will see an overview of philosophy of language, the formal meaning of words, how to define our concepts, intention and extension of terms, types, purposes, and techniques of definition, the standard criteria of lexical definitions, and finally, we will discuss about how to use definition to evaluate arguments.

           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             One of the most fundamental questions asked in Philosophy of Language is "what is language (in general terms)?" According to <strong>semiotics</strong>, language is the mere manipulation and use of symbols in order to draw attention to signified content. Semiotics is the study of sign processes in communication and of how meaning is constructed and understood.
           </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
             Philosophy of Language is the reasoned inquiry into the origins of language, nature of meaning, the usage and cognition of language, and the relationship between language and reality. It is an important discipline in its own right, and hence, it poses questions like "What is meaning?", "How does language refer to the real world?", "Is language learned or is it innate?", "How does the meaning of a sentence emerge out of its parts?, and other related issues.

           <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Philosophy of Language vs Linguistics</h2>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Philosophy of language, however, should not be confused with <strong>Linguistics</strong>, because Linguistics is the field of study that asks questions like: What distinguishes one particular language from another e.g. what is it that makes "English" English? What is the difference between Spanish and French?
           </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
              Linguists, like Noam Chomsky, a figure who has come to define the 20th century linguistics, have emphasized the role of "grammar" and syntax (the rules that govern the structure of sentences) as a characteristic of any language. Chomsky believes that humans are born with an innate understanding of what he calls "universal grammar" (an innate set of linguistic principles shared by all humans) and a child's exposure to a particular language just triggers this antecedent knowledge. Chomsky begins with the study of people's internal language (what he calls "I-languages"), which are based upon certain rules which generate grammars, supported in part by the conviction that there is no clear, general and principled difference between one language and the next, and which may apply across the field of all languages. Other attempts, which he dubs "E-languages", have tried to explain a language as usage within a specific speech community with a specific set of well-formed utterances in mind.

           <p class="text-gray-600">
             Translation and interpretation present other problems to philosophers of language. The resulting view is called <strong>Semantic Holism</strong>, a type of Holism which holds that meaning is not something that is associated with a single word or sentence, but can only be attributed to a whole language (if at all).

           <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">1.2 A Brief Note on the Debates and History of Philosophy of Language</h2>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             In the Western tradition, the early work was covered, by Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics of Ancient Greece. Plato generally considered that the names of things are determined by nature, with each phoneme (the smallest structural unit that distinguishes meaning) representing basic ideas or sentiments, and that convention only has a small part to play.
           </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Aristotle held that the meaning of a predicate (the way a subject is modified or described in a sentence) is established through an abstraction of the similarities between various individual things (a theory later known as <strong>Nominalism</strong>). His assumption that these similarities are constituted by a real commonality of form, however, also makes him a proponent of moderate <strong>Realism</strong>.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">History of Philosophy of Language (Continued)</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              The Stoic philosophers made important contributions to the analysis of grammar, distinguishing five parts of speech: nouns, verbs, appellatives, conjunctions and articles. What they called the <strong>lektón</strong> (the meaning, or sense, of every term) gave rise to the important concept of the proposition of a sentence (its ability to be considered an assertion, which can be either true or false).
            </p>
             <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
               The Scholastics of the Medieval era were greatly interested in the subtleties of language and its usage, provoked to some extent by the necessity of translating Greek texts into Latin. They considered Logic to be a "science of language", and anticipated many of the most interesting problems of modern Philosophy of Language, including the phenomena of <strong>vagueness</strong> and <strong>ambiguity</strong>, the doctrines of proper and improper supposition (the interpretation of a term in a specific context), and the study of categorematic and syncategorematic words and terms.
             </p>
             <p class="text-gray-600">
               Linguists of the Renaissance period were particularly interested in the idea of a philosophical language (or universal language), spurred on by the gradual discovery in the West of Chinese characters and Egyptian hieroglyphs.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Philosophy of Language - Central Role</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              The philosophical study of language, finally, began to play a more central role in Western philosophy in the late 19th and 20th Centuries, especially philosophical branches of Analytic Philosophy and philosophy as a whole was understood to be purely a matter of Philosophy of Language.
            </p>
             <p class="text-gray-600">
               To sum up, philosophy of language is the reasoned inquiry into the nature, origins, and usage of language. As a topic, the philosophy of language, particularly for analytic Philosophers, has been concerned with four central problems: the nature of meaning, language use, language cognition, and the relationship between language, logic and reality. For continental philosophers, however, the philosophy of language tends to be dealt with, not as a separate topic, but as a part of logic and other field of studies.

             <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">1.3 Some Philosophical Approaches to the Nature of Meaning</h2>
             <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
               The question, "what is meaning?", is not immediately obvious. Most frequently, “Meaning” can be described as the content carried by the words or signs exchanged by people when communicating through language.
             </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600">
                Arguably, there are two essentially different types of linguistic meaning: <strong>conceptual meaning</strong> (which refers to the definitions of words themselves, and the features of those definitions, which can be treated using semantic feature analysis) and <strong>associative meaning</strong> (which refers to the individual mental understandings of the speaker, and which may be connotative, collocative, social, affective, reflected or thematic).

              <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Major Approaches to the Nature of Meaning</h2>
               <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">There are several approaches to the philosophical nature of meaning. Among others, the following are the major ones:</p>
               <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
                 <li>
                   <strong>Idea theories:</strong> these theories claim that meanings are purely mental contents provoked by signs. This approach is mainly associated with the British Empiricist traditions of John Locke, George Berkeley and David Hume, though some contemporary theorists have renewed it under the guise of semantic internalism.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <strong>Truth-conditional theories:</strong> these theories hold meaning to be the conditions under which an expression may be true or false. This tradition goes back to Gottlob Frege, although there has also been much modern work in this area.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <strong>Use theories:</strong> these theories understand meaning to involve or be related to speech acts and particular utterances, not the expressions themselves. This approach was pioneered by Ludwig Wittgenstein and his Communitarian view of language.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <strong>Reference theories (or semantic externalism):</strong> these theories view meaning to be equivalent to those things in the world that are actually connected to signs. Tyler Burge and Saul Kripke are the best known proponents of this approach.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <strong>Verificationist theories:</strong> these theories associate the meaning of a sentence with its method of verification or falsification. This Verificationist approach was adopted by the Logical Positivists of the early 20th century.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <strong>Pragmatist theories:</strong> these theories maintain that the meaning or understanding of a sentence is determined by the consequences of its application?

                   The statement in Example 1 is intended primarily to convey information while the statement in Example 2 is intended, at least in part, to express or evoke feelings. These statements accomplish their respective functions through the distinct kinds of terminology in which they are phrased.

                  <p class="text-gray-600">
                    Terminology that conveys information is said to have <strong>cognitive meaning</strong>, and terminology that expresses or evokes feelings is said to have <strong>emotive meaning</strong>. Thus, in Example 1 the words “Death penalty,” “legal,” and “thirty-six” have primarily a cognitive meaning, while in Example 2 the words “cruel,” “inhuman,” “hapless,” “dragged,” “slaughtered,” and “bloodlust,” and “vengeful” have a strong emotive meaning. Of course, these latter words have cognitive meaning as well. “Cruel” means tending to hurt others, “inhuman” means inappropriate for humans, “hapless” means unfortunate, and so on.

                 <p class="text-gray-600">
                   <strong>First,</strong> statements of this sort usually have both cognitive meaning and emotive meaning. Therefore, since logic is concerned chiefly with cognitive meaning, it is important that we be able to distinguish and disengage the cognitive meaning of such statements from the emotive meaning.

                  <p class="text-gray-600">
                    <strong>Second,</strong> part of the cognitive meaning of such statements is a <strong>value claim</strong>. A value claim is a claim that something is good, bad, right, wrong, or better, worse, more important or less important than some other thing. For example, the statement about the death penalty asserts the value claim that the death penalty is wrong or immoral. Such value claims are often the most important part of the cognitive meaning of emotive statements. Thus, for the purposes of logic, it is important that we be able to disengage the value claims of emotively charged statements from the emotive meaning and treat these claims as separate statements.

                  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Why People Use Emotive Terminology</h2>
                   <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                     These observations suggest the reason that people use emotive terminology as often as they do. Value claims as such normally require evidence to support them. For example, the claim that the death penalty is immoral cannot simply stand by itself. It cries out for reasons to support it. But the fact that a value claim is being made, and it simultaneously gives psychological momentum to that claim. As a result, readers and listeners are inclined to swallow the value claim whole without any evidence.
                   </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                      Furthermore, the intellectual laziness of many speakers and writers, combined with their inability to supply supporting reasons for their value claims, reinforces the desirability of couching such claims in emotive terminology. Many people, for example, will refer to someone as “crazy,” “stupid,” or “weird” when they want to express the claim that what that person is doing is bad or wrong and when they are unable or unwilling to give reasons for this claim.

                   <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                     Let us now consider emotive terminology as it occurs in arguments. In arguments, emotive terminology accomplishes basically the same function as emotive terminology in statements. It allows the arguer to make value claims about the subject matter of the argument without providing evidence, and it gives the argument a kind of steamroller quality by which it tends to crush potential counter arguments before the reader or listener has a chance to think of them.
                   </p>
                   <p class="text-gray-600">
                     This steamroller quality also tends to paralyze the logical thought processes of readers or listeners so that they are not able to see illogical arguments in their true light. These effects of emotive terminology can be avoided if the reader or listener will disengage the value claims and other cognitive meanings from the emotive meaning of the language and re-express them as distinct premises.

                     The conclusion of this argument is that our government should take money that has been spent on the space program and on international police actions and redirect it to solving domestic problems. The author minimizes the importance of the space program by covertly suggesting that it amounts to nothing more than work on ordinary rocks and tadpoles (which, by themselves are relatively insignificant), and he exaggerates the scope of the international effort by covertly suggesting that it has solved every problem on earth but our own. Also, the phrase “put . . . in order” suggests that the international effort has been no more important than restoring order to a room in one’s house.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                      We might rephrase the argument in emotively neutral language, making the implicit suggestions and value claims explicit, as follows:
                    </p>
                     <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mt-4 text-gray-600">
                       <p>P-1: The space program has been confined to work on ordinary rocks and tadpoles.</p>
                       <p>P-2: Ordinary rocks and tadpoles are less important than domestic hunger and unemployment.</p>
                       <p>P-3: Our international efforts have restored order to every nation on earth but our own.</p>
                       <p>P-4: These efforts have been directed to problems that are less important than our own domestic problems.</p>
                       <p>C: Therefore, our government should redirect funds that have been spent on these projects to solving our own domestic problems.</p>
                     </div>
                     <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">
                       By restructuring the argument in this way, we can more easily evaluate the degree to which the premises support the conclusion. Inspection of the premises reveals that the first, third, and possibly fourth premises are false. Thus, the actual support provided by the premises is less than what we might have first expected. If the argument were to be rephrased a second time so that the premises turned out true (for example, the first premise might read “Part of the space program has been devoted to research on ordinary rocks and tadpoles”), the support given to the conclusion would still be weaker than the author intended.

                     <p class="text-gray-600">
                       Now that we have distinguished emotive meaning from cognitive meaning, let us explore some of the ways that cognitive meanings can be defective. Two problems that affect our cognitive use of language are vagueness and ambiguity.
                     </p>
                  </div>

                  <!-- Slide 26: Vagueness -->
                  <div class="slide">
                     <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Vagueness</h2>
                     <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                       A linguistic expression is said to be <strong>vague</strong> if there are borderline cases in which it is impossible to tell if the expression applies or does not apply. Vague expressions often allow for a continuous range of interpretations. The meaning is hazy, obscure, and imprecise. For example, words such as “love,” “happiness,” “peace,” “excessive,” “fresh,” “rich,” “poor,” “normal,” “conservative,” and “polluted” are vague. We can rarely tell with any precision whether they apply to a given situation or not. How fresh does something have to be in order to be called fresh?
                     </p>
                      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                        Vagueness can also affect entire statements. Such vagueness may arise not so much from the individual words as from the way in which the words are combined. For example, suppose someone were to say, “Today our job situation is more transparent.” First, what is the meaning of “job situation”? Does it refer to finding a job, keeping a job, filling a job, completing a job, or bidding on a job? And what exactly does it mean for a job situation to be “transparent”? Does it mean that the job is more easily perceived or comprehended? That the job is more easily completed? That we can anticipate our future job needs more clearly? Or what else?
                      </p>
                      <p class="text-gray-600">
                         Not all cases of vagueness, however, are problematic. To describe a person as “tall” or “thin” causes no trouble in ordinary conversation. Indeed, it may be overly burdensome to describe this person in more precise language. Trouble arises only when the language is not sufficiently precise for what the situation demands.

                     <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                       The other way in which cognitive meanings can be defective is ambiguity. An expression is said to be <strong>ambiguous</strong> when it can be interpreted as having more than one clearly distinct meaning in a given context.
                     </p>
                      <p class="text-gray-600">
                        For example, words such as “light,” “proper,” “critical,” “stress,” “mad,” “inflate,” “chest,” “bank,” “sound,” and “race” can be used ambiguously. Thus, if one were to describe a beer as a light pilsner, does this mean that the beer is light in color, light in calories, or light in taste? If one were to describe an action as proper, does this mean proper in a moral sense or proper in the sense of being socially acceptable? Or if one were to describe a person as critical, does this mean that the person is essential for a certain task or that the person tends to criticize others?

                     <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Vagueness vs. Ambiguity</h2>
                     <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">As is the case with vagueness, ambiguity can also affect entire statements. Such ambiguity often results from the way in which certain words are combined.</p>
                      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                        The difference between ambiguity and vagueness is that vague terminology allows for a relatively continuous range of interpretations, whereas ambiguous terminology allows for multiple discrete interpretations. In a vague expression there is a <strong>blur</strong> of meaning, whereas in an ambiguous expression there is a <strong>mix-up</strong> of otherwise clear meanings. However, there are many forms of expression that are ambiguous in one context and vague in another.
                      </p>
                       <p class="text-gray-600">
                         For example, the word “slow” in one context could mean either mentally retarded or physically slow, but when the word refers to physical slowness, it could be vague. How slow is slow? Similar remarks apply to “light,” “fast,” and “rich.”

Worku, on the other hand, is using the word in the legal sense. Because Dagim has not been convicted in a court of law, he is not legally guilty of anything.

                        Disputes that arise over the meaning of language are called <strong>verbal disputes</strong>. These are disputes in which the apparent conflict is not genuine and can be resolved by coming to agreement about how some words or phrases is to be understood.

                          The main task of logic is the evaluation of arguments. However, as we saw in the previous section, there are countless arguments, in which this task leads to the observation. Such an observation usually indicates that the meaning of certain words in the argument is vague or ambiguous. Clearing up the problem often involves supplying a definition. Thus, the study of meaning and definition is closely related to the main task of logic. In this section, we will continue our inquiry into aspects of linguistic meaning, and the results of this inquiry will provide the basis for the theory of definition in the next sections.

                           The basic units of any ordinary language are words. Our main concern in this chapter, however, is not with words in general but with <strong>terms</strong>. A <strong>term</strong> is any word or arrangement of words that may serve as the subject of a statement. Terms consist of proper names, common names, and descriptive phrases. Here are some examples:

                         At this point, it is important to distinguish the <strong>use of a word</strong> from the <strong>mention of a word</strong>. Without this distinction any word can be imagined to serve as the subject of a statement and, therefore, to count as a term. The word “wherever,” for example, is not a term, but “wherever” (in quotes) can serve as the subject of a statement, such as “’Wherever’ is an eight-letter word.” But in this statement, it is not the word itself that is the subject but rather the quoted word. The word is said to be mentioned- not used. On the other hand, “wherever” is used in this statement: “I will follow you wherever you go.”

                          Words are usually considered to be symbols, and the entities they symbolize are usually called <strong>meanings</strong>. Terms, being made up of words, are also symbols, but the meanings they symbolize are of two kinds: <strong>intensional</strong> and <strong>extensional</strong>.

                           The <strong>intensional meaning</strong> (which is otherwise known as <strong>intension</strong> or <strong>connotation</strong>) consists of the qualities or attributes that the term connotes, and the <strong>extensional meaning</strong> (which is otherwise known as <strong>extension</strong> or <strong>denotation</strong>) consists of the members of the class that the term denotes.

                       <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                         For example, the intensional meaning of the term “cat” consists of the attributes of being furry, of having four legs, of moving in a certain way, of emitting certain sounds, and so on, while the extensional meaning consists of cats themselves- all the cats in the universe. The term connotes the attributes and denotes the cats.
                       </p>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                          “Intension” and “extension” are roughly equivalent to the more modern terms “sense” and “reference,” respectively. Also, it should be noted that logic uses the terms “connotation” and “denotation” differently from the way they are used in grammar. In grammar, “connotation” refers to the subtle nuances of a word, whereas “denotation” refers to the word’s direct and specific meaning.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">
                          Because terms symbolize meanings to individual persons, it is inevitable for subjective elements to invade the notion of connotation. To a cat lover the term “cat”, for example, might connote the attributes of being cuddly and adorable, while to someone who hates cats it might connote the attributes of being obnoxious and disgusting. To avoid this problem, logicians typically restrict the meaning of connotation to what is usually called the <strong>conventional connotation</strong>. The conventional connotation of a term includes the attributes that the term commonly calls forth in the minds of competent speakers of the language. Under this interpretation, the connotation of a term remains more or less the same from person to person and from time to time.

                         The denotation of a term also typically remains the same from person to person, but it may change with the passage of time. The denotation of “currently living cat,” for example, is constantly fluctuating as some cats die and others are born. The denotation of the term “cat,” on the other hand, is presumably constant because it denotes all cats, past, present, and future. Sometimes the denotation of a term can change radically with the passage of time. The terms “currently living dodo bird” and “current king of France,” for example, at one time denoted actually existing entities, but today all such entities have perished. Accordingly, these terms now have what is called <strong>empty extension</strong>.

                         They are said to denote the empty (or “null”) class, the class that has no members. While these terms have empty extension, however, they do not have empty intension, for they connote a variety of intelligible attributes.

                            The fact that some terms have empty extension leads us to an important connection between extension and intension- that <strong>intension determines extension</strong>. The intensional meaning of a term serves as the criterion for deciding what the extension consists of. Because we know the attributes connoted by the term “unicorn”- a term with empty extension-, we for example, know that the term has empty extension. That is, we know that there are no four-legged mammals having a single straight horn projecting from their forehead.

                             Similarly, the intension of the word “cat” serves as the criterion for determining what is and what is not a member of the class of cats.

                          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                            One kind of term that raises problems for the intension-determines-extension rule is <strong>proper names</strong>. For example, the proper name “Abebe” might appear to have any intension, but it denotes the person who has this name.
                          </p>
                           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                             Although philosophers have disagreed about this, it would seem that proper names must have some kind of intension or we would not know what persons, if any, they denote. Thus, we solve the problem. One possible solution to this problem is that names are shorthand symbols for descriptions or bundles of descriptions. For example, “Abebe” could be shorthand for “the first year student of Civil Engineering department, since 2005 E.C.” or “the person who is a representative of this section.”
                           </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">
                              Another possible solution to the problem of proper names is that the intension of proper names consists of the causal chain of events leading from the point at which the name is first assigned to the point at which a certain person learns about the name. Thus, the first link in such a chain might be the baptismal event at which the name “Abebe” is given to a certain infant, the second link would be the event in which a certain third party is informed of the first infant, and so on. This entire chain of events extending through the linguistic community would then constitute the intension of “Abebe.” Thus, we conclude that for all terms, including proper names, intension determines extension.

                           The distinction between intension and extension may be further illustrated by comparing the way in which these concepts can be used to give order to random sequences of terms. Terms may be put in the order of increasing intension, increasing extension, decreasing intension, and decreasing extension.

                            A series of terms is in the order of <strong>increasing intension</strong> when each term in the series (except the first) connotes more attributes than the one preceding it. In other words, each term in the series (except the first) is more specific than the one preceding it. (A term is specific to the degree that it connotes more attributes.)

                            <p class="text-gray-600">Dear learners, definition is a technical and structural organization of words and/or terms or phrases in explaining the meaning of a given term. For most logicians, definitions are intended exclusively to explicate the meaning of words. Hence, we may define <strong>definition</strong> as a group of words that assigns a meaning to some word or group of words. Accordingly, every definition consists of two parts: the <strong>definiendum</strong> and the <strong>definiens</strong>. The                            definiendum is the word or group of words that is supposed to be defined, and the definiens is the word or group of words that does the defining.

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">For example, in the definition ‘Tiger’ means a large, striped, ferocious feline indigenous to the jungles of India and Asia,” the word “Tiger” is the definiendum, and everything after the word “means” is the definiens.</p>
                             <p class="text-gray-600">The definiens is not itself the meaning of the definiendum; rather, it is the group of words that symbolizes (or that is supposed to symbolize) the same meaning as the definiendum. Because we presumably know in advance what the definiens symbolizes, we are led, via the definition, to understand what the definiendum symbolizes. It is in this way that the definition “assigns” a meaning to its definiendum.</p>

                           <p class="text-gray-600">There are various kinds of definitions that are actually used in our practical life. Based on the functions that they actually serve, definitions can be classified into five: stipulative, lexical, précising, theoretical, and persuasive definitions. Let us discuss them in detail.</p>
                         </div>

                          <!-- Slide 49: Stipulative Definitions -->

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                              A <strong>stipulative definition</strong> is a definition assigns a meaning to a word for the first time. This may involve either coining a new word or giving a new meaning to an old word. The purpose of a stipulative definition is usually to replace a more complex expression with a simpler one.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">
                              The need for a stipulative definition is often occasioned by some new phenomenon or development. For example, the attempt, which has made a few years ago at a certain zoo to crossbreed tigers and lions, has been succeeded because of the genetic similarity of the two species- that offspring were produced from a male tiger and a female lion and from a male lion and a female tiger. When the offspring were born, it became appropriate to give them names. Of course, the names “offspring of male tiger and female lion” and “offspring of male lion and female tiger” could have been used, but these names were hardly convenient. Instead, the names “tigon” and “liger” were selected. Any two new words would have sufficed equally well for naming the offspring- “topar” and “largine”, for example, but “tigon” and “liger” were considered more appropriate, for obvious reasons. Hence, “Tigon” was taken to mean the offspring of a male tiger and a female lion, and “liger” the offspring of a male lion and a female tiger. These assignments of meanings were accomplished through stipulative definitions.

                              <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                                Another use for stipulative definitions is to set up secret codes. For example, during World War II, “Tora, Tora, Tora” was the code name Admiral Yamamoto transmitted to the war office in Tokyo signaling that the Japanese fleet had not been spotted in the hours preceding the bombing of Pearl Harbor. More recently, “Operation Desert Storm” was the code name given to the military invasion of Iraq. Law enforcement organizations have adopted similar code names for sting operations against organized crime.

                              <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                                It is important to note that because a stipulative definition is a completely arbitrary assignment of a meaning to a word for the first time, there can be no such thing as a “true” or “false” stipulative definition. Furthermore, for the same reason, a stipulative definition cannot provide any new information about the subject matter of the definiendum. The fact that the word “tigon” was selected to replace “offspring of a male tiger and a female lion” tells us nothing new about the nature of the animal in question. One stipulative definition may, however, be more or less convenient or more or less appropriate than another.
                              </p>
                              <p class="text-gray-600">
                                Stipulative definitions are misused in verbal disputes when one person covertly uses a word in a peculiar way and then proceeds to assume that everyone else uses that word in the same way. Under these circumstances the assumption that other persons use the word in the same way is rarely justified. It is important, however, to be aware that insofar as people keep coming up with new creations, whether it be new food concoctions, new inventions, new modes of behavior, new kinds of apparel, new dances, or whatever, the demand for stipulative definitions will continue.

                               This definition is used to report the meaning that a word already has in a language. Dictionary definitions are all instances of lexical definitions. Thus, in contrast with a stipulative definition, a <strong>lexical definition</strong> may be true or false depending on whether it does or not report the way a word is actually used.

                              <p class="text-gray-600">
                                Because words are frequently used in more than one way, lexical definitions have the further purpose of eliminating the ambiguity that would otherwise arise if one of these meanings were to be confused with another.

                               As we saw in the first section of this chapter, an expression is ambiguous when it can be interpreted as having two or more clearly distinct meanings in a given context. Words such as “light,” “proper,” “critical,” “stress,” “mad,” “inflate,” “chest,” “bank,” “sound,” and “race” can be used ambiguously.
                             </p>
                              <p class="text-gray-600">
                                Because a lexical definition is intended to report the various meanings that a word can have, a person who consults such a definition is better prepared to avoid ambiguous constructions of his or her own and to detect those of others. Undetected ambiguity causes the most trouble. In many cases the problem lies not with the obvious differences in meaning that words such as “light” and “bank” may have but with the subtle shadings of meaning that are more likely to be confused with one another. For example, if a woman is described as “nice,” any number of things could be intended. She could be fastidious, refined, modest, pleasant, attractive, or even lewd. A good lexical definition will distinguish these various shadings and thereby guard against the possibility that two such meanings will be unconsciously jumbled together into one.

                                The purpose of a <strong>précising definition</strong> is to reduce the vagueness of a word. As we saw in the first section of this chapter, an expression is vague if there are borderline cases in which it is impossible to tell if the expression applies or does not apply. Words such as “fresh,” “rich,” and “poor” are vague. Once the vagueness of such words is reduced by a précising definition, one can reach a decision as to the applicability of the word to a specific situation. For example, if legislation were ever introduced to give direct financial assistance to the poor, a précising definition would have to be supplied specifying exactly who is poor and who is not. The definition “‘Poor’ means having an annual income of less than $4,000 and a net worth of less than $20,000” is an example of a précising definition.

                                Whenever words are taken from ordinary usage and used in a highly systematic context such as science, mathematics, medicine, or law, they must always be clarified by means of a précising definition. The terms “force,” “energy,” “acid,” “element,” “number,” “equality,” “contract,” and “agent” have all been given précising definitions by specific disciplines.

                               Sometimes the substance of a court trial may revolve around the precise usage of a term. A trial in California addressed the question of whether a man who had driven a bicycle while intoxicated violated the motor vehicle code. The question concerned whether, for these purposes, a bicycle could be considered a “vehicle.” The court decided in the affirmative, and the decision amounted to an incremental extension of an already existent précising definition of the word “vehicle.”

                               Another example involves the practice of surgical transplantation of vital organs. Before a heart transplant can be conducted, the donor must be dead; otherwise, the surgeon will be accused of murder. If the donor is dead for too long, however, the success of the transplant will be imperiled. But exactly when is a person considered to be dead? Is it when the heart stops beating, when the person stops breathing, when rigor mortis sets in, or some other time? The question involves the meaning of the term “moment of death.” The courts have decided that “moment of death” should be taken to mean the moment the brain stops functioning, as measured by an electroencephalograph. This decision amounts to the acceptance of a précising definition for “moment of death.”

                               A <strong>theoretical definition</strong> assigns a meaning to a word by suggesting a theory that gives a certain characterization to the entities that the term denotes. Such a definition provides a way of viewing or conceiving these entities that suggests deductive consequences, further investigation (experimental or otherwise), and whatever else would be entailed by the acceptance of a theory governing these entities.

                                The definition of the term “heat” found in texts dealing with the kinetic theory of heat provides a good example: “‘Heat’ means the energy associated with the random motion of the molecules of a substance.” This definition does more than merely assign a meaning to a word; it provides a way of conceiving the physical phenomenon that is heat. In so doing, it suggests the deductive consequence that as the molecules of a substance speed up the temperature of the substance increases. In addition, it suggests a number of experiments- experiments investigating the relationship between molecular velocity and the phenomena of radiation, gas pressure, molecular elasticity, and molecular configuration. In short, this definition of “heat” provides the impetus for an entire theory about heat.

                               However, not all theoretical definitions are associated with science. Many terms in philosophy, such as “substance”, “form”, “cause”, “change”, “idea”, “good”, “mind”, and “God” have been given theoretical definitions. In fact most of the major philosophers in history have given these terms their own peculiar theoretical definitions, and this fact accounts in part for the unique character of their respective philosophies. For example, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz’s definition of “substance” in terms of what he called “monads” laid the foundation for his metaphysical theory, and John Stuart Mill’s definition of “good” as the greatest happiness of the greatest number provided the underpinnings for his utilitarian theory of ethics.

                               Like stipulative definitions, theoretical definitions are neither true nor false, strictly speaking. The reason is that theoretical definitions function as proposals to see or interpret some phenomenon in a certain way. Since proposals have no truth value, neither do theoretical definitions. They may, however, be more or less interesting or more or less fruitful, depending on the deductive consequences they entail and on the outcome of the experiments they suggest.

                                The purpose of a <strong>persuasive definition</strong> is to engender a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward what is denoted by the definiendum. This purpose is accomplished by assigning an emotionally charged or value-laden meaning to a word while making it appears that the word really has (or ought to have) that meaning in the language in which it is used. Thus, persuasive definitions amount to a certain synthesis of stipulative, lexical, and, possibly, theoretical definitions backed by the rhetorical motive to engender a certain attitude. As a result of this synthesis, a persuasive definition masquerades as an honest assignment of meaning to a term while condemning or blessing with approval the subject matter of the definiendum.

                               While persuasive definitions may, like lexical definitions, be evaluated as either true or false, the primary issue is neither truth nor falsity but the effectiveness of such definitions as instruments of persuasion. Giving their primary objective- i.e., influencing the attitudes of the reader/listener- persuasive definitions may be used with considerable effectiveness in political speeches and editorial columns.

                               An <strong>extensional definition</strong> is one that assigns a meaning to a term by indicating the members of the class that the definiendum denotes. There are at least three ways of indicating the members of a class: pointing to them (demonstrative or ostensive definitions), naming them individually (enumerative definitions), and naming them in groups (definitions by subclass).

                               <strong>Demonstrative (Ostensive) Definitions</strong> are probably the most primitive form of definition. All one need know to understand such a definition is the meaning of pointing. Such definitions may be either partial or complete, depending on whether all or only some of the members of the class denoted by the definiendum are pointed to.

                                <p>“Chair” means this and this and this- as you point to a number of chairs, one after the other.</p>

                                If you were attempting to teach a foreigner your own native language, and neither of you understood a word of each other’s language, demonstrative definition would almost certainly be one of the methods you would use.

                                Demonstrative definitions are also the most limited. In addition to the limitations affecting all extensional definitions, there is the obvious limitation that the required objects be available for being pointed at. For example, if one wishes to define the word “sun” and it happens to be nighttime, a demonstrative definition cannot be used.

                                 Complete enumerative definitions are usually more satisfying than partial ones because they identify the definiendum with greater assurance. However, relatively few classes can be completely enumerated.

                                <strong>Definition by Subclass</strong> assigns a meaning to a term by naming subclasses of the class denoted by the term. Such a definition, too, may be either partial or complete, depending on whether the subclasses named, when taken together, include all the members of the class or only some of them. See the following examples, the first is partial, the second is complete:

                                 As with definitions by enumeration, complete definitions by subclass are more satisfying than partial ones; but because relatively few terms denote classes that admit of a conveniently small number of subclasses, complete definitions by subclass are often difficult, if not impossible, to provide.

                                 Extensional definitions are chiefly used as techniques for producing lexical and stipulative definitions. Lexical definitions are aimed at communicating how a word is actually used, and one of the ways of doing so is by identifying the members of the class that the word denotes. Dictionaries, for example, frequently include references to the individual members (enumerative definition), or to the subclasses of the class (definition by subclass) denoted by the word being defined; and sometimes to the picture of the object that word symbolizes (demonstrative).
                               </p>
                                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                                  The task of stipulative definitions may be accomplished by all three kinds of extensional definition. For example, a biologist engaged in naming and classifying types of fish might assign names to the varieties by pointing to their respective tanks (demonstrative definition), and then she might assign a class name to the whole group by referring to the names of the specific varieties (definition by subclass). And an organizer of a children’s game might make the stipulation: “’John, Mary, and Billy will be called ‘Buccaneers,’ and Judy, George, and Nancy will be ‘Pirates’” (enumerative definition).
                                </p>

                                  Although it is conceivable that extensional definitions could also serve as techniques for theoretical and persuasive definitions (though this would be highly unusual), extensional definitions by themselves cannot properly serve as précising definitions, for the following reason: The function of a précising definition is to clarify a vague word, and vagueness is a problem affecting intensional meaning. Because the intension is imprecise, the extension is indefinite. To attempt to render the intension precise by exactly specifying the extension (as with an extensional definition) would be tantamount to having extension determine intension- which cannot be done.

                                 When a single word can be found that has the same intensional meaning as the word being defined, a synonymous definition is a highly concise way of assigning a meaning. However, many words have subtle shades of meaning that are not connoted by any other single word. For example, the word “wisdom” is not synonymous with either “knowledge”, “understanding”, or “sense”.

                                 <strong>Etymological Definition</strong> assigns a meaning to a word by disclosing the word’s ancestry in both its own language and other languages. For example, the English word “license” is derived from the Latin verb *licere*, which means to be permitted. Etymological definitions have special importance for at least two reasons. The first reason is that the etymological definition of a word often conveys the word’s root meaning or seminal meaning from which all other associated meanings are derived. Unless one is familiar with this root meaning, one often fails to place other meanings in their proper light or to grasp the meaning of the word when it is used in its most proper sense. For example, the word “principle” derives from the Latin word *principium*, which means beginning or source. Accordingly, the “principles of physics” are those fundamental laws that provide the “source” of the science of physics.

                                 The second reason why etymological definitions have a special importance is that if one is familiar with the etymology of one word, one often has access to the meaning of an entire constellation of related words. For example, if one is familiar with the etymological definition of “polygon” (from the Greek words poly, meaning many, and ganos meaning angle), one might grasp the meanings of “polygamy” (from *gamos*, meaning marriage).

                                 <strong>Definition by Genus and Difference</strong> assigns a meaning to a term by identifying a genus term and one or more difference words that, when combined, convey the meaning of the term being defined. It is is more generally applicable and achieves more adequate results than any of the other kinds of intensional definition. To explain how it works, we must first explain the meanings of the terms “genus,” “species,” and “specific difference.”

                                  In logic, “genus” and “species” have a somewhat different meaning than they have in biology. In logic, “genus” simply means a relatively larger class, and “species” means a relatively smaller subclass of the genus. For example, we may speak of the genus animal and the species mammal, or of the genus mammal and the species feline, or of the genus feline and the species tiger, or the genus tiger and the species Bengal tiger.

The required genus is water. Next we must identify a specific difference (attribute) that makes ice a special form of water. The required difference is frozen. The completed definition may now be written out:

Lexical definitions are typically definitions by genus and difference, but they also often include etymological definitions. Operational definition can serve as the method for constructing stipulative, lexical, précising, and persuasive definitions, but because of the limitations we have noted, it typically could not be used to produce a complete lexical definition. Other techniques would have to be used in addition.</p>

                                     <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 mt-4">A definition cannot be helpful if it fails to convey the essential meaning of the definiendum. Any definition that defines the word “human” as “featherless biped”, for instance, cannot be helpful since it fails to convey the essential meaning of “human” as the word is used in ordinary English. It says nothing about the important attributes that distinguish humans from the other animals, namely, the capacity to reason and to use language on a sophisticated level. Thus, a more adequate definition would be “‘Human’ means the animal that has the capacity to reason and to speak.”</p>

An operational definition should be supplemented, because, as we have noted above, it often conveys only part of the intensional meaning of a word, and this part frequently misses the essential meaning altogether. As for extensional definitions, at best they can only suggest the essential meaning of a word; they cannot determine it precisely. As a result, no adequate lexical definition can consist exclusively of extensional definitions.

If, for example, “bird” were defined as any warm-blooded animal having wings, the definition would be too broad because it would include bats, and bats are not birds. If, on the other hand, “bird” were defined as any warm-blooded, feathered animal that can fly, the definition would be too narrow because it would exclude ostriches, which cannot fly.</p>
                                       <p class="text-gray-600">The only types of lexical definitions that tend to be susceptible to either of these deficiencies are synonymous definitions and definitions by genus and difference. With synonymous definitions, one must be careful that the definiens really is a synonym of the definiendum.

                                          Language is the most important thing in the study of logic. Giving that logic is the study of arguments, and language is the fundamental tool of communication, there is not only a strong relationship between language and logic but also the former has a prominent position within the discipline of the latter. Argument, as the most special subject matter of logic, is nothing but a reasoning process that is constructed and conveyed through language. The clarification and analysis of terms and statements is the objective of philosophy in general and logic in particular.

                                           In order to interpret, analyze, and evaluate arguments well, one must pay close attention to language. Many errors in logic stem from a careless or imprecise use of language, and many misunderstandings about the nature of language. Hence, if we are to successfully evaluate the logical correctness of arguments, it is important to pay a special attention to the language in which the arguments are cast. More specially, meanings and definitions are very important both, for clear, effective, and comprehensive communications, and for logical, scientific, and critical evaluations of arguments. Before we decide whether the requirements of a certain argument are fulfilled, it is necessary to understand the meanings of the words that make up the statements, which in its turn, make up the given argument.

                                           Language has two fundamental functions in logic, conveying information and expressing or evoking feeling, which are expressed through some terminologies. Those terminologies that convey information are said to have cognitive meanings, and those that expresses or evokes feelings are said to have emotive meanings. Emotively charged statements usually have both cognitive meaning and emotive meaning. However, since logic is concerned chiefly with cognitive meaning, our primary concern should be to distinguish and disengage the cognitive meaning of emotive statements from the emotive meaning, which is commonly known as a value claim. Value claims are usually the most important part of the cognitive meaning of emotive statements. Thus, for the purposes of logic, it is important that we be able to disengage the value claims of emotively charged statements from the emotive meaning and treat these claims as separate statements.

                                            Vagueness and ambiguity are the two linguistic problems that affect our cognitive use of language. A linguistic expression is said to be vague if there are borderline cases in which it is impossible to tell if the expression applies or does not apply. Vague expressions often allow for a continuous range of interpretations. An expression is said to be ambiguous when it can be interpreted as having more than one clearly distinct meaning in a given context. The role of vagueness and ambiguity in arguments may be conveniently explored in the context of conflicting arguments between individuals. Such conflicts are called disputes. Disputes can be verbal or factual. The former centers on a confusion of cognitive meanings between disputants, while the later on a matter of fact.

                                           Terms symbolize two kinds of meanings: intensional meaning and extensional meaning. The intensional meaning, which is otherwise known as intension or connotation, consists of the qualities or attributes that the term connotes, and the extensional meaning, which is otherwise known as extension or denotation, consists of the members of the class that the term denotes. To avoid the subjective elements that invades the notion of connotation, and of course that of denotation, logicians typically restrict the meaning of connotation and denotation to the conventional connotation and denotation. Sometimes extensions can be empty, but intensions.

                                           Meanings are conveyed or explicated by definitions. A definition is a group of words that assigns a meaning to some word or group of words; and consists of two parts: the definiendum, (the word or group of words that is supposed to be defined ), and the definiens, (the word or group of words that does the defining). It is, however, important to note that the definiens is not itself the meaning of the definiendum; rather, it is the group of words that symbolizes (or that is supposed to symbolize) the same meaning as the definiendum that are actually used in our practical life. Based on the functions they actually serve, definitions can be classified as stipulative, lexical, précising, theoretical, and persuasive definitions. These definitions can be produced by extensional definitional techniques, (demonstrative/ostensive, enumerative, and subclass), and intensional definitional techniques, (synonymous, etymological, operational, and genus and difference). Because lexical definition the most important and common definition, it is important for it to fulfill some standard linguistic rules.
