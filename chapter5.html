        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We have seen in chapter two that an argument can be good or bad, depending on the relationship between the premises and a conclusion. An argument is good as far as it meets all the general criteria set for a good argument. If, however, it fails to do so, or violates them, it becomes bad, and hence, fallacious. A fallacy is, therefore, a defect in an argument (or, a mistake frequently committed in reasoning) that consists in something other than merely false premises.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          It can be committed in many ways, but usually it involves either a mistake in reasoning or the creation of some illusion that makes a bad argument appear good (or both). That is, a fallacy is often committed because of the problem in the reasoning process or the form of the argument, or defects in the contents of the statements used as premises or a conclusion. For that matter, both deductive and inductive arguments may contain fallacies.

            Depending on the kind of the problems or defects they contain, (i.e., the problems or defects that make them fallacious), arguments may commit either a formal or an informal fallacy. As a result, they are often grouped in two: <strong>Formal fallacies</strong> and <strong>informal fallacies</strong>. If an argument contains a structural defect or problem and violates the standard form of a good argument because of that, it commits a formal fallacy. Because the defect that causes it is structural, a formal fallacy may be identifiable through mere inspection of the form or structure of an argument. Fallacies of this kind are found only in deductive arguments that have identifiable forms. If, however, the defect of a certain argument goes far beyond a structural problem and attacks the very content of the argument, then that particular argument commits an informal fallacy. Because they have the ability to hide their true argumentative forms, informal fallacies cannot be identified through mere inspection of the form or structure of an argument. Only a detail analysis to be applied on the content of an argument can reveal the source of the trouble.

                 <p class="italic text-gray-600">Dear learners, are you familiar with the term ‘fallacy’? Have you ever used the term for any purpose? If so, what do you mean by ‘fallacy’?</p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Dear learners, the word ‘fallacy’ is a general term that refers to a logical defect or flaw or fault that a certain argument exhibits in its structural arrangement or reasoning process, or in the contents of its statements used as premises or a conclusion, for various reasons, other than merely false premises. In general, it is a violation of standard argumentative rules or criteria.

             </div>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
              There are four general criteria of a good argument, which specifically evaluate the relevance, acceptability, sufficiency, and rebuttablity of the premises. A good argument must have premises that: are relevant to the truth of the conclusion, are acceptable to a logical person, together constitute sufficient grounds for the truth of the conclusion, and anticipate and provide an effective rebuttal to all reasonable challenges to the argument or to the position supported by it.
            </p>

             <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Meaning of Fallacy (Continued)</h2>
             <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
               A premise is relevant, if its acceptance provides some reason to believe, counts in favor of, or makes a difference to the truth or falsity of the conclusion. Otherwise, it is irrelevant. A premise is acceptable, if it is a reason, that the skeptic is likely to accept, or that a rational person is ought to accept, or agreed on. However, an argument may not be good, even though its premises may be relevant and acceptable, unless they are sufficient enough in number, kind and weight. Finally, a good argument should also provide an effective rebuttal (refutation, or disproof) to the support of the alternative position.
             </p>
             <p class="text-gray-600">Therefore, fallacy is the violation of one or more of these criteria of a good argument. That is, an argument is good as far as it meets all the general criteria set for a good argument, and hence commits no fallacy. It, however, becomes bad, if it violates any one of them, and hence fallacious.</p>

             <p class="text-gray-600">
               Fallacies are usually divided into two groups: formal and informal. Depending on the kind of the problems or defects they contain, (i.e., the problems or defects that make them fallacious), arguments may commit either a formal or an informal fallacy. A fallacy committed due to a structural defect of argument is known as a <strong>formal fallacy</strong>. Because the problem that causes them is a structural defect, formal fallacies are identifiable through mere inspection of the form or structure of an argument. Fallacies of this kind are found only in deductive arguments that have identifiable forms. If, however, the defect of a certain argument goes far beyond a structural problem and attacks the very content of the argument, then that particular argument commits an <strong>informal fallacy</strong>. Because they have the ability to hide their true argumentative forms, informal fallacies cannot be identified through mere inspection of the form or structure of an argument. Only a detail analysis to be applied on the content of an argument can reveal the source of the trouble.

           <div class="slide">
              <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Formal Fallacy Example</h2>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Formal fallacies are found only in deductive arguments that have identifiable forms, such as categorical syllogisms, disjunctive syllogisms, and hypothetical syllogisms. The following categorical syllogism contains a formal fallacy:
              </p>
               <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600">
                 <p>All tigers are animals.</p>
                 <p>All mammals are animals.</p>
                 <p>Therefore, all tigers are mammals.</p>
               </div>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">This argument has the following form:</p>
               <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600">
                 <p>All A are B.</p>
                 <p>All C are B.</p>
                 <p>-------------------</p>
                 <p>All A are C.</p>
               </div>
               <p class="text-gray-600">Through mere inspection of this form, one can see that the argument is invalid. The fact that A, B, and C stand respectively for “tigers,” “animals,” and “mammals” is irrelevant in detecting the fallacy. The problem may be traced to the second premise. If the letters C and B are interchanged, the form becomes valid, and the original argument, with the same change introduced, also becomes valid (but unsound).</p>
           </div>

            <!-- Slide 11: Formal Fallacy Example (Affirming the Consequent) -->
            <div class="slide">
               <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Formal Fallacy Example (Affirming the Consequent)</h2>
               <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Here is an example of a formal fallacy that occurs in a hypothetical syllogism:</p>
                <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600">
                  <p>If apes are intelligent, then apes can solve puzzles.</p>
                  <p>Apes can solve puzzles.</p>
                  <p>----------------</p>
                  <p>Therefore, apes are intelligent.</p>
                </div>
               <p class="text-gray-600">This argument has the following form:</p>
                <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600">
                  <p>If A, then B.</p>
                  <p>B.</p>
                  <p>----------------</p>
                  <p>A.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">This type of fallacy is called <strong>affirming the consequent</strong>. In this case, if A and B are interchanged in the first premise, the form becomes valid, and the original argument, with the same change, also becomes valid (but unsound).</p>

               <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Formal Fallacy Recognition</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                  In distinguishing formal from informal fallacies, remember that formal fallacies occur only in deductive arguments. Thus, if a given argument is inductive, it cannot contain a formal fallacy. Also, keep an eye out for standard deductive argument forms such as categorical syllogisms and hypothetical syllogisms. If such an argument is invalid because of an improper arrangement of terms or statements, it commits a formal fallacy.
                </p>
             </div>

             <!-- Slide 13: Informal Fallacies Intro -->

               <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Informal fallacies</h2>
               <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                 <strong>Informal fallacies</strong> are those mistakes in reasoning process of an argument that cannot be recognized by analyzing the structure of an argument, but only through analysis of the content of the argument. Only the meaning of the words, how the statements are constructed and how inferences are made that reveals the faulty reasoning. Consider the following example:
               </p>
                <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600">
                  <p>All factories are plants.</p>
                  <p>All plants are things that contain chlorophyll.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, all factories are things that contain chlorophyll.</p>
                </div>
               <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">A cursory inspection of this argument might lead one to think that it has the following form:</p>
                <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600">
                  <p>All A are B.</p>
                  <p>All B are C.</p>
                  <p>----------------</p>
                  <p>All A are C.</p>
                </div>

               <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                 Since this form is valid, one might conclude that the argument itself is valid. Yet the argument is clearly invalid because it has true premises and a false conclusion. An analysis of the content—that is, the meaning of the words—reveals the source of the trouble. The word “plants” is used in two different senses. In the first premise it means a building where something is manufactured, and in the second it means a life form. Thus, the argument really has the following invalid form:
               </p>
                <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600">
                  <p>All A are B.</p>
                  <p>All C are D.</p>
                  <p>------------------</p>
                  <p>All A are D.</p>
                </div>
               <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                 Since the time of Aristotle, logicians have attempted to classify the various informal fallacies. Aristotle himself identified thirteen and separated them into two groups. The work of subsequent logicians has produced dozens more, rendering the task of classifying them even more difficult.

               <p class="text-gray-600">
                 The presentation that follows divides twenty-two informal fallacies into five groups: fallacies of relevance, fallacies of weak induction, fallacies of presumption, fallacies of ambiguity, and fallacies of grammatical analogy.

                 <strong>Fallacies of relevance</strong> are those, (except missing the point) which are committed chiefly due to a provision premises that are logically irrelevant to the conclusion. Unlike the others, the fallacy of missing the point is committed due to an irrelevant conclusion. In this , we will discuss eight fallacies of relevance: Appeal to force, Appeal to pity, Appeal to people, Argument against the person, Accident, Straw man, Missing the point, and Red Herring.

               <p class="text-gray-600">
                 The fallacies of relevance share the common characteristic- that the arguments, in which they occur, have premises that are logically irrelevant to the conclusion. Yet the premises are relevant psychologically, so the conclusion may seem to follow from the premises, even though it does not follow logically. In a good argument the premises provide genuine evidence in support of the conclusion. In an argument that commits a fallacy of relevance, on the other hand, the connection between premises and conclusion is emotional. Such arguments are often called <strong>non sequiturs</strong>, which means that the conclusion does not seem to follow from the premises. They are also sometimes called <strong>argumentative leaps</strong>, which suggest that since no connection is seen between the premises and the conclusion, a huge leap (jump) would be required to move from one (the premises) to the other (the conclusion). To identify a fallacy of relevance, therefore, one must be able to distinguish genuine evidence from various forms of emotional appeal.

                </div>
               <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                 The first type of fallacy of relevance is <strong>appeal to force</strong>. It occurs when an arguer poses a conclusion to another person and tells that person either implicitly or explicitly that some harm will come to him if he does not accept the conclusion. In other words it occurs when a conclusion defended by a threat to the well- being of those who do not accept the conclusion.
               </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600">This fallacy always involves a threat by the arguer to the physical or psychological well- being of the listener. But this threat is logically irrelevant to the subject matter of the conclusion even though it seems psychologically relevant. Consider the following argument in which the arguer uses unjustified physical threat on the listeners.</p>
             </div>

                 <p>Mr. Kebde you accused me of fraud and embezzlements. You have to drop the charge you filed against me. You have to remember that I am your ex-boss; I will torture both you and your family members if you do not drop your case. Got it?</p>
               </div>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                  This is a fallacious argument; the arguer is threatening the listener to abandon his charge. The above argument can be re-written to expose the faulty reasoning most clearly.
                </p>
                 <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600">
                   <p>Mr. Kebede you have to drop your charge, otherwise you will face accident.</p>
                 </div>
                <p class="text-gray-600">You can see that the conclusion is supported by force. The threat “accident” has no logical bearing on the conclusion however (you have to drop your charge).</p>

                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Appeal to force need not use sheer physical force to support a certain conclusion. Consider the following argument.</p>
                 <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600">
                   <p>Lately there has been a lot of negative criticism of our policy on dental benefits. Let me tell you something, people. If you want to keep working here, you need to know that our policy is fair and reasonable. I won’t have anybody working here who doesn’t know this.</p>
                 </div>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Now this is a blatant example, which shows an explicit use of psychological force to impose a conclusion. The arguer is trying to impose the conclusion that you (workers) should accept the dental benefit policy as fair and reasonable. The reason given however does not support the conclusion. It says that ‘any worker who does not accept this conclusion would be fired.’ But a threat to loss a job cannot constitute a reason to support the proposition that the dental policy is reasonable and fair. Thus, it is unjustified appeal to force. Such kinds of argument have the following form:</p>
                 <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600">
                   <p>Premise: You can avoid harm by accepting the conclusion that the policy is fair and reasonable.</p>

                   The appeal to force fallacy usually accomplishes its purpose by psychologically impeding the reader or listener from acknowledging a missing premise that, if acknowledged, would be seen to be false or at least questionable. Finally, a note of caution: The fact that an argument mentions a threat does not necessarily make it a fallacy.

                  The second type of fallacy relevant is <strong>appeal to pity</strong>. The appeal to pity (or ad misericordiam fallacy) is the attempt to support a conclusion merely by evoking pity from the reader or listener. The statements that evoke the pity are logically unrelated to the conclusion. The appeal to pity is not, generally speaking, very subtle. But if the arguer succeeds in evoking sufficiently strong feelings of pity, he or she may distract the audience from the logic of the situation and create a desire to accept the conclusion. The appeal to pity fallacy has the following form.
                </p>
                 <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600">

                 </div>
                 <p class="text-gray-600">
                   The conclusion of this argument is “The Headship position in the department of accounting should be given to Mr. Oumer Abdulla”. But the reason given is the pathetic condition of the arguer though they do psychologically. It may be pitiful to see people under these conditions; but this does not mean that such conditions are logically relevant in every situation to decide. A certain position should be open to people to fill when they have the necessary qualification. The relevant logical reason in this situation for Oumer Abdulla to qualify for the position is if he fulfills the necessary educational experience. But ‘he has six hungry children to feed and his wife needs operation’ does not lend reason to accept the conclusion. So this is illegitimate appeal to pity.

                   There is a tendency to take argument from pity as inherently fallacious. But this is not always the case. There are arguments from pity, which are reasonable and plausible. There are situations where compassion or sympathy could be a legitimate response for some situations.
                 </p>
                  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                    Most society values helping people in time of danger; showing compassion and sympathy is a natural response in some situation. If some group of people are in danger, helping out may require appeal to the compassion or pity of other people. Consider the following argument.

                   As you can see this is argument from compassion, in which the conclusion is based on the feeling of sympathy. The natural response of compassion and pity is a legitimate and reasonable response. These children deserve special consideration or compassion; they deserve help from the community. One of the main reasons for this deservingness is that the situation in which they found themselves in is due to factor beyond their control. They are not responsible for the situation in which they are in. If people are not responsible for the situation in which they are in; it is perfectly reasonable and sensible to show compassion for these people.

                 <p class="text-gray-600">
                   In fact, this is the main justification for some social policies to help out old people, disables, orphan and other people who are in bad situation due to factor which is beyond their control. Helping people in problem when they are not responsible is reasonable. But if the people are in bad situation in which they are responsible as a cause, showing of compassion may be illegitimate and argument in which the conclusion is depend on illegitimate appeal to compassion is a fallacy - appeal to pity fallacy.

Feeling of being part of community and belongingness are some of the most important humans needs. The appeal to the people strikes these desires and needs to get acceptance for conclusion.

Premises to the effect that “I am proud to be associated with you” and “you are hard-working people” are irrelevant to the conclusion (that “our view of trade arguments is right”). As you can see, the arguer uses the feeling of individuals to be part of the group to accept his conclusion. And anyone who wants to be part of the group, who does not want to be deviated from the mob mentality, accepts the conclusion as true.</p>

                     Two approaches are involved in appeal to people fallacy: <strong>direct</strong> and <strong>indirect</strong>. The <strong>direct approach</strong> occurs when an arguer, addressing a large group of people, excites the emotions and enthusiasm of the crowd to win acceptance for his or her conclusion. The objective is to arouse a kind of mob mentality. This is the strategy used by nearly every propagandist and demagogue. Because the individuals in the audience want to share in the camaraderie, the euphoria, and the excitement, they find themselves accepting any number of conclusions with ever-increasing fervor.
                   </p>
                   <p class="text-gray-600">
                     In the <strong>indirect approach</strong>, the arguer aims his or her appeal not at the crowd as a whole but at one or more individuals separately, focusing on some aspect of their relationship to the crowd. The indirect approach is very common in most advertising industries. There are three recognizable forms in indirect approach: <strong>Bandwagon</strong>, <strong>Vanity</strong>, and <strong>Snobbery</strong>.

                     <strong>Bandwagon fallacy</strong> is a kind of fallacy that commonly appeals to the desire of individuals to be considered as part of the group or community in which they are living. One of the characteristics of community or group is that they share some values and norms. Not only they share but also every individual are expected to manifest group conformity to these shared values. Bandwagon fallacy just uses these emotions and feelings to get acceptance for a certain conclusion. For instance, consider the following example.
                   </p>
                   <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600">

It only means that the right to life should be taken seriously in a discussion on ethical principles, because people have put some thought into such matters in the past, and their unanimity on accepting this principle indicates a presumption in its favor.</p>

                       to sum up, in the direct approach the arousal of a mob mentality produces an immediate feeling of belonging for each person in the crowd. Each person feels united with the crowd, which evokes a sense of strength and security. When the crowd roars its approval of the conclusions that are then offered, anyone who does not accept them automatically cuts himself or herself off from the crowd and risks the loss of his or her security, strength, and acceptance. The same thing happens in the indirect approach, but the context and technique are somewhat subtler.

                       <strong>Argument against the person</strong> is another type of relevance fallacy. This fallacy always involves two arguers. One of them advances (either directly or implicitly) a certain argument and the other then responds by directing his or her attention not to the first person’s argument but to the person himself. When this occurs, the second person is said to commit an argument against the person.

                        Attacking the other party’s honesty or sincerity in argument is a powerful move. Such an argument leads one to the conclusion that such a person lacks credibility as an arguer who can be trusted to play by the rules. This argument is so powerful because it suggests that such a person cannot ever be trusted and that therefore whichever argument they use, it may simply be discounted as worthless. Thus, the person attacked cannot meaningfully take part in the dialogue any longer, no matter how many good arguments they seem to have. Because they are so powerful and dangerous, ad hominem arguments have often been treated in the past as fallacious.

                        In this type of argument, A is the proponent of an argument that has been put forward. The premise that is alleged is that A is a person of bad character.

                         The attack is directed to destroying the person’s credibility, so that his argument is discounted or reduced in plausibility because of the reduction in credibility of the arguer.

                         The second type of against the person fallacy is <strong>ad hominem circumstantial</strong>. The ad hominem circumstantial begins the same way as the ad hominem abusive, but instead of heaping verbal abuse on his or her opponent, the respondent attempts to discredit the opponent’s argument by alluding to certain circumstances that affect the opponent. By doing so the respondent hopes to show that the opponent is predisposed to argue the way he or she does and should therefore not be taken seriously. Consider the following example:

                         This argument is fallacious because the arguer does not pay serious attention to the substance of the argument of the king. He just tried to discredit the idea of the king by association it with the circumstance with the Italian evacuation. He did not attack directly why member states should not help the country. The ad hominem circumstantial is easy to recognize because it always takes this form: “Of course, Mr. X argues this way; just look at the circumstances that affect him.”

The second arguer usually accomplishes this by citing features in the life or behavior of the first arguer that conflict with the latter’s conclusion. This fallacy has the following form: “How dare you argue that you should stop doing X; why, you do (or have done) X yourself.”

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Let us consider the first two types of against the person fallacy: abusive and circumstantial. In many textbooks, the direct ad hominem argument is called ‘abusive’, suggesting that it is a fallacious argument and is always wrong. But it can sometimes be reasonable argument. For example, in legal argumentation in a trial, it can be legitimate for a cross examining attorney to question the ethical character of a witness. The lawyer may even argue that the witness has lied in the past and use this argument to raise questions about his character for honesty. In such kind of argument, what is normally cited is some aspect of the person character, and often, character for veracity is the focus of the attack.</p>

                         The same is true in the case of circumstantial fallacy. It involves the attempt to discredit an opponent by suggesting that the opponent’s judgment is distorted by some factor in his or her background condition. In some circumstances and conditions, the kind of belief people entertain or the kind of argument they advance could be purely the function of their circumstances. It is mere sociological facts that societies are segmented into many groups depend on their economic, social, religious, political and other factors. It is also true that the kind of political, economic and religious system one belongs to determine to a certain extent of what kind of ideas and beliefs people advocate. In general, what people accept as true to a greater or lesser degree determine by the particular position they assume in the society. In other word, most often people judgment blinded by their circumstances.

                         Thus, it is not always false that ad hominem fallacies are inherently unacceptable. Sometimes it could be reasonable and plausible to consider some judgment of individuals as blinded and limited by their circumstance. Capitalists and rich people want a free market economy where they can easily produce as much fortune as possible. They do not see the consequence of their action on the environment or on other people. Workers also want increase of salary without regard to its effects on the economy of the country or to the company. This shows that the circumstance of people affects their idea. Consider the following argument, which is advanced by director of medical association.

                           This argument seems that it is unreasonable and thus it is a fallacy of circumstance. But close inspection may reveals that it may not be a fallacy. This argument argues for increment of salary. Before judging whether it is a fallacy or not, we need to consider the economic conditions of the country and the relative income of medical doctor. If, in fact the country cannot afford salary increment and medical doctors a as profession receives reasonably adequate income, it would be promoting self- interest to claim for additional salary.

                           The main function of premises in an argument is to provide reasons so that a reasonable person would accept the truth of the conclusion. It is a rule of a good argument to contain premises that together constitute sufficient grounds for the truth of the conclusion. They must provide sufficient reasons for a rational person to accept the conclusion as true. In some arguments, premises provide strong reason for the conclusion to be acceptable. Sometimes, however, premises may not successfully support the conclusion. If premises do not support the conclusion strongly then the resulting argument will be labeled as <strong>Weak Induction</strong>.

                          <p class="text-gray-600">The fallacy of weak induction violates the principles of sufficiency, which states that whenever a person presents an argument for or against a position, he/she should attempt to provide relevant and acceptable reasons of the right kind, that together are sufficient in number and weight to justify the acceptance of the conclusion. Therefore, the fallacies of weak induction occur not because the premises are logically irrelevant to the conclusion, as is the case with the eight fallacies of relevance, but because the connection between premises and conclusion is not strong enough to support the conclusion.</p>

                           We saw in the second chapter that argument from authority is inductive argument. It is discussed that appeal to authority or otherwise called appeal to expert opinion is an argument in which the conclusion depends on a testimony of expert or knowledgeable people.

                           The <strong>appeal to unreliable authority</strong> (or <strong>ad verecundiam fallacy</strong>) is an appeal to an authority when the reliability of the authority may be reasonably doubtable. When an appeal to unreliable authority is made, the arguer assumes, without sufficient warrant, that the authority in question is reliable. When there is legitimate doubt about whether an authority is reliable, then the appeal to authority is fallacious. Ad verecundiam fallacies are common in advertising when celebrities who lack the relevant expertise endorse products. Consider the following example.

                           A more subtle appeal to unreliable authority occurs when a well-known expert in one field is cited as an expert in another field even though he or she lacks expertise in it. This form of fallacy is especially subtle if the two fields are related. Consider the following example.
                         </p>

                           This argument also reminds us of another point to keep in mind when evaluating an appeal to authority, namely, that the appeal to authorities in matters of controversy is often problematic. After all, in such matters, the authorities themselves often disagree. And when this occurs, if we have no good reason to suppose that one authority is more likely to be correct than another, then the appeal to authority should be unconvincing. For instance, in matters involving religious and moral issues it is difficult to find an ultimate authority to give final decision. Whatever the expertise of the authority, it is safe not to depend on this authority for knowledge.

                           <strong>Appeal to ignorance</strong> (or <strong>Argumentum ad Ignorantiam</strong>) is committed when the premises of an argument state that nothing has been proved one way or the other about something, and the conclusion then makes a definite assertion about that thing, the argument commits an appeal to ignorance. The issue usually involves something that is incapable of being proved or something that has not yet been proved. Observe the following example:

                           The premises of an argument are supposed to provide positive evidence for the conclusion. The premises of these arguments, however, tell us nothing about the alleged relationship between Haileselassie I of Ethiopia and Kind David of Israel; rather, they tell us about what certain unnamed and unidentified people have tried unsuccessfully to do. This evidence may provide some slight reason for believing the conclusion, but certainly not sufficient reason.

                            However, these examples do lead us to the first of two important exceptions to the appeal to ignorance. The first stems from the fact that if qualified researchers investigate a certain phenomenon within their range of expertise and fail to turn up any evidence that the phenomenon exists, this fruitless search by itself constitutes positive evidence about the question. Consider, for example, the following argument:
                          </p>
                           <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600">

Therefore, we must conclude that King Tewodros actually committed suicide at Maqdella.</p>

                           The premises of this argument are true. Given the circumstances, it is likely that the historian in question would have proved if King Tewodros II did not commit suicide. Since they did not proof it, it likely that he did commit suicide. Thus, we can say that the above argument is inductively strong.
                         </p>
                         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                           As for the two arguments about the alleged relationship between Haileselassie I of Ethiopia and Kind David of Israel, if the attempts to prove or disprove the historical claims had been done in a systematic way by qualified experts, it is more likely that the arguments would be good. But as these arguments stand, the premises state nothing about the qualifications of the investigators, and so the arguments remain fallacious.

                           The second exception to the appeal to ignorance relates to courtroom procedure. In Ethiopia, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. If the prosecutor in a criminal trial fails to prove the guilt of the defendant beyond reasonable doubt, counsel for the defence may justifiably argue that his or her client is not guilty. Example:
                         </p>
                          <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600 mt-2">
                            <p>Members of the jury, you have heard the prosecution present its case against the defendant. Nothing, however, has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, under the law, the defendant is not guilty.</p>

                           This argument commits no fallacy because “not guilty” means, in the legal sense, that guilt beyond a reasonable doubt has not been proved. The defendant may indeed have committed the crime of which he or she is accused, but if the prosecutor fails to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant is considered “not guilty.”

                           <strong>Hasty generalization</strong> (or <strong>Converse Accident</strong>) is a defective form of argument from inductive generalization. A generalization is an argument that proceeds from the knowledge of a selected sample to some claim about the whole group. Because the members of the sample have a certain characteristic, it is argued that all the members of the group have that same characteristic. For example, if we wanted to know the opinion of the student body at a certain university about whether to adopt a law prohibiting the use of face book in campuses, we could take a poll of 10 per cent of the students. If the results of the poll showed that 80 percent of those sampled favored the law, we might draw the conclusion that 80 percent of the entire student body favored it. These illustrate the use of statistics in inductive argumentation.

                           The problem that arises with the use of samples has to do with whether the sample is representative of the population. Samples that are not representative are said to be biased. Depending on what the population consists of, whether machine parts or human beings, different considerations enter into determining whether a sample is biased. These considerations include (1) whether the sample is randomly selected, (2) the size of the sample, and (3) psychological factors.

                            A sample is random if and only if every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. The requirement that a sample be randomly selected applies to practically all samples, but sometimes it can be taken for granted. The randomness requirement must be given more attention when the population consists of discrete units. The randomness requirement presents even greater problems when the population consists of human beings.

                             Suppose, for example, that a public opinion poll is to be conducted on the question of environmental protection. It would hardly do to ask such a question randomly capitalists and owner of multinational companies. Such a sample would almost certainly be biased in favor of the corporations. A less biased sample could be obtained by randomly selecting phone numbers from the telephone directory, but even this procedure would not yield a completely random sample. Among other things, the time of day in which a call is placed influences the kind of responses obtained. Most people who are employed full time are not available during the day, and even if calls are made at night, a large percentage of the population have unlisted numbers.

                           A poll conducted by mail based on the addresses listed in the city directory would also yield a fairly random sample, but this method, too, has shortcomings. Many dwellers may not be listed, and others move before the directory is printed. Furthermore, none of those who live in rural areas are listed. In short, it is both difficult and expensive to conduct a large-scale public opinion poll that succeeds in obtaining responses from anything approximating a random sample of individuals.

                            Size is also an important factor in determining whether a sample is representative. Given that a sample is randomly selected, the larger the sample, the more closely it replicates the population. In statistics, this degree of closeness is expressed in terms of sampling error. The sampling error is the difference between the relative frequency with which some characteristic occurs in the sample and the relative frequency with which the same characteristic occurs in the population. If, for example, a poll were taken of workers and 60 percent of the members sampled expressed their intention to vote for Gudeta but in fact only 55 percent of the whole union intended to vote for Gudeta, the sampling error would be 5 percent. If a larger sample were taken, the error would be less.

                             Now we can discuss about hasty generalization. It is a fallacy that affects inductive generalizations. The fallacy occurs when there is a reasonable likelihood that the sample is not representative of the group. Such likelihood may arise if the sample is either too small or not randomly selected. Consider the following examples.

                           <strong>False cause fallacy</strong> is a defective and flawed form of argument from causality. Before discussing about false cause, we need to discuss about causal inference first. Argument from causality is a kind of argument which argues either from the knowledge of causes to the knowledge of effects or from the knowledge of the effect to the knowledge of causes. In such argument two things are presented as having causal connection.

                            However, it seems that there is no settled scientific theory of causality. It seems that the causal relationship is practical and contextual in nature. What it means to say that, one state of affairs A causes another state of affairs B, is that A is something that can be brought about and when it is brought about (or stopped), then B is also brought about (or stopped).

                           Whatever causality means, the most important kind of evidence that event A causes event B in any particular case, is that there is a statistical correlation between A and B: event A and event B are correlated. For example, if a significant statistical correlation is found between reduced incidence of heart attacks and drinking of red wine, the tentative conclusion may be drawn as a hypothesis is that drinking red wine is the cause of the reduction in heart attacks.

                           A <strong>correlation</strong> is a purely statistical relationship, determined by counting up numbers where one event occurs in a case where another event also occurs. One problem with arguments from correlation to cause is that there may not be a real correlation between two events, but people might believe that relation exists. Another problem is that a statistical correlation between two events can simply be a coincidence. Consider the following example.

According to a report in Newsweek researchers at the conference reported on the beneficial effects of pet companionship. Studies showed that women who had owned dogs as children scored higher on self-reliance, sociability, and tolerance tests than petless women. Men who had owned a dog “felt a greater sense of personal worth and of belonging and had better social skills.” Children with pets also showed greater empathy.</p>

In a case like this, there may be a genuine correlation between two factors A and B, but the reason for the correlation is that some third factor C, is causing both A and B. In such a case, it is not correct to draw the conclusion that A causes B.

                             Argument from correlation to cause is extremely useful for practical purposes in guiding action in practical matters. But in many cases, there is a natural human tendency to leap too quickly to a causal conclusion once a correlation has apparently been observed. In such cases, it is better to ask appropriate critical questions before placing too much weight on an argument from correlation to cause.

                             The fallacy of false cause occurs whenever the link between premises and conclusion depends on some imagined causal connection that probably does not exist. Whenever an argument is suspected of committing the false cause fallacy, the reader or listener should be able to say that the conclusion depends on the supposition that X causes Y, whereas X probably does not cause Y at all. There are many varieties of false cause fallacy. Perhaps the most common form is <strong>post hoc, ergo propter hoc</strong>, which means in Latin “after this, therefore because of this,” This form of the false cause fallacy occurs whenever an arguer illegitimately assumes that because event X preceded event Y, X caused Y. Here is an example:

                             The longer prison sentences may be a causal factor, of course, but the mere fact that the longer sentences preceded the decrease in violent crime does not prove this. Many other possible causal factors need to be considered. For example, have economic conditions improved? Are more jobs available? Have the demographics of the area changed so that the population of young men is smaller relative to the population as a whole? Has there been an increase in the number of police officers on patrol? Obviously, mere temporal succession is not sufficient to establish a causal connection. Nevertheless, this kind of reasoning is quite common and lies behind most forms of superstition.

                             The second type of fallacy is called <strong>non causa pro causa</strong> (“not the cause for the cause”).

This variety occurs when a multitude of causes is responsible for a certain effect but the arguer selects just one of these causes and represents it as if it were the sole cause.

                             <strong>Slippery slope fallacy</strong> is a defective form of argument from slippery slope. Before discussing about slippery slope fallacy, some points should be raised about slippery slope argument. One very common form of argumentation is used when one party in a dialogue says to the other, “This action would not be good, because it could have bad consequences.” For example, suppose you are thinking of taking a certain medication and your doctor says, “You have high blood pressure, and taking this medication raises blood pressure, so in your case there would be a bad side effect of taking it.” This form of argumentation is called argument from consequences.

                             It cites allegedly foreseeable consequences of a proposed action as the premise, and the conclusion is then inferred that this course of action is or is not recommended. This form of reasoning can be used in a positive or negative way, as an argument to respond to a proposal that has been put forward when two parties are having a dialogue on what to do. In argument from positive consequences, a policy or course of action is supported by citing positive consequences of carrying out this policy or course of action. In argument from negative consequences, a policy or course of action is argued against by citing negative consequences of carrying it out.

                              A slippery slope argument is a species of negative reasoning from consequences, used where two parties are deliberating together and one warns the other not to take a contemplated action, because it is a first step in a sequence of events that will lead to some horrible outcome. What is distinctive about the slippery slope argument as a special subtype of argument from consequences is that there is said to be a connected sequence of actions, such that once the first action in the series is carried out, a sequence of other actions will follow, so that once the sequence starts there is no stopping it, until (eventually) the horrible outcome comes about. This particularly horrible outcome is the final event in the sequence and represents something that would very definitely go against goals that are important for the participant in the deliberation who is being warned, for example, it might be his personal safety or security.

                              The characteristic idea of the slippery slope argument is that once you take that first action in the sequence, it is like pushing off from the top of an Olympic ski-jump run. Once you have kicked off, turning back becomes harder and harder. At some ill-defined point or grey area, there is no turning back. Once you are into this area, there is only one way to go: faster and faster down the slope until you hit the bottom (with disastrous consequences of personal injury), the message is that you had better not take that first step at all.

It is only to say that, logically speaking, when causal connections are claimed, there needs to be sufficient evidence that the connections are genuine.

Deciding whether a slippery slope fallacy has been committed can be difficult when there is uncertainty whether the alleged chain reaction will or will not occur. But many slippery slopes rest on a mere emotional conviction on the part of the arguer that a certain action or policy is bad, and the arguer attempts to trump up support for his or her position by citing all sorts of dire consequences that will result if the action is taken or the policy followed. In such cases there is usually little problem in identifying the argument as a slippery slope.</p>

                               <strong>Weak analogy</strong> is a defective or flawed argument from analogy. Argument from analogy is a very commonly used kind of case-based reasoning, where one case is held to be similar to another case in a particular respect. Since the one case is held to have a certain property, then the other case, it is concluded, also has the same property (because the one case is similar to the other).

                               Two things, situations or cases could be similar to each other in certain respects, but dissimilar in other respects. While one case may be generally similar to another, it does not mean that the two cases will be similar in every respect. If they were similar in every respect, they would be identical case. However, two cases can be generally similar, even though there are quite important differences between them. Consider the following example.

It is built onto an argument from analogy; based on a comparison between the two cases. Of course, the two cases are different in certain respects, but by comparing them, it puts forward a plausible argument.

                                The fallacy of weak analogy is committed when the analogy between things, situations and circumstance is not strong enough to support the conclusion that is drawn. Evaluating an argument having this form requires a two-step procedure: (1) Identify the attributes a, b, c,.. that the two entities A and B share in common, and (2) determine how the attribute z, mentioned in the conclusion, relates to the attributes a, b, c, . . . If some causal or systematic relation exists between z and a, b, or c, the argument is strong; otherwise it is weak.

                                  In the example above about the similarity between mice and human being, it was evaluated as strong argument because there is systematic relation between the two. For example both are mammals and as such they share common similarities that belong to all mammals. In addition to this, being animals is the bases for further similarities. Since they share similarity in terms of biological metabolism, this tendency will provide a strong reason for the conclusion to be true. Most probably both will respond in similar way for the substance alpha. Consider the following weak analogy argument.

                                  This argument is based on a similarity between the growth of cancer in human body and the existence of criminals in society. It is true that when a certain cell is identified as cancer every effort would be made to kill it because it is impossible to rehabilitate the cell and the only safe measure is to kill the cell. But this is not true in human being. Even if a criminal is bad for society, society avoids crime not by killing criminals but by educating and rehabilitating individual criminals. Thus this analogy is fallacy because the conclusion is based on weak or inadequate analogy between a human being and a cell.

                                 The fallacies of presumption include <strong>begging the question</strong>, <strong>complex question</strong>, <strong>false dichotomy</strong>, and <strong>suppressed evidence</strong>. These fallacies arise not because the premises are irrelevant to the conclusion or provide insufficient reason for believing the conclusion but because the premises presume what they purport to prove. Begging the question presumes that the premises provide adequate support for the conclusion when in fact they do not, and complex question presumes that a question can be answered by a simple “yes,” “no,” or other brief answer when a more sophisticated answer is needed. False dichotomy presumes that an “either . . . or . . .” statement presents jointly exhaustive alternatives when in fact it does not, and suppressed evidence presumes that no important evidence has been overlooked by the premises when in fact it has. In this , we will discuss the fallacies of presumption.

The Latin name for this fallacy, petitio principii, means “request for the source,” The actual source of support for the conclusion is not apparent, and so the argument is said to beg the question.

These premises are crucial for the soundness of the arguments. If the arguer is unable to establish the truth of these premises, then the arguments prove nothing. However, in most cases of begging the question, this is precisely the reason why such premises are left unstated. The arguer is not able to establish their truth, and by employing rhetorical phraseology such as “of course,” “clearly,” “this being the case,” and “after all,” the arguer hopes to create the illusion that the stated premise, by itself, provides adequate support for the conclusion when in fact it does not.

Without supporting reasons or evidence, the argument proves nothing. Yet most people who are predisposed to believe the conclusion are likely to accept the argument as a good one. The same can be said of most arguments that beg the question, and this fact suggests another reason why arguers resort to this fallacy: Such arguments tend to reinforce pre-existing inclinations and beliefs.

                                   The fallacy of <strong>complex question</strong> is committed when two (or more) questions are asked in the guise of a single question and a single answer is then given to both of them. Every complex question presumes the existence of a certain condition. When the respondent’s answer is added to the complex question, an argument emerges that establishes the presumed condition. Thus, although not an argument as such, a complex question involves an implicit argument.

The correct response lies in resolving the complex question into its component questions and answering each separately.

A leading question is one in which the answer is in some way suggested in the question. Whether or not a question is a leading one is important in the direct examination of a witness by counsel.

                                     The fallacy of <strong>false dichotomy</strong> is committed when a disjunctive (“either . . . or . . .”) premise presents two unlikely alternatives as if they were the only ones available, and the arguer then eliminates the undesirable alternative, leaving the desirable one as the conclusion. Such an argument is clearly valid, but since the disjunctive premise is false, or at least probably false, the argument is typically unsound. The fallacy is often committed by children when arguing with their parents, by advertisers, and by adults generally. Here are three examples:

For example, in the first argument, the arguer tries to convey the impression that democracy cannot originates in other places than Athens or the Gada System and that no other alternatives are possible. Clearly, however, this is not the case.

                                     The fallacious nature of false dichotomy lies in the illusion created by the arguer that the disjunctive premise presents jointly exhaustive alternatives. If it did, the premise would be true of necessity. For example, the statement “Either Awash River is in Afar, or it is not in Afar” presents jointly exhaustive alternatives and is true of necessity.
                                   </p>

                                      But in the fallacy of false dichotomy, the two alternatives not only fail to be jointly exhaustive, but they are not even likely. As a result, the disjunctive premise is false, or at least probably false. Thus, the fallacy amounts to making a false or probably false premise appear true. If one of the alternatives in the disjunctive premise is true, then fallacy is not committed. For example, the following argument is valid and sound:
                                    </p>

If an inductive argument does indeed ignore such evidence, then the argument commits the fallacy of <strong>suppressed evidence</strong>. Consider the following argument:

                                      Perhaps the most common occurrence of the suppressed evidence fallacy appears in inferences based on advertisements. Nearly every advertising neglect to mention certain negative features of the product advertised. As a result, an observer who sees or hears an advertisement and then draws a conclusion from it may commit the fallacy of suppressed evidence. Example:
                                    </p>

                                      The advertise fails to state that the fun does not come packaged with the chicken but must be supplied by the buyer. Also, of course, the advertise fails to state that the chicken is loaded with fat and that the buyer’s resultant weight gain may not amount to a barrel of fun. By ignoring these facts, the argument based on the advertising is fallacious.

                                      Another way that an arguer can commit the suppressed evidence fallacy is by ignoring important events that have occurred with the passage of time that render an inductive conclusion improbable. Here is an example:
                                    </p>

                                      <p>During the past fifty years, Poland has enjoyed a rather low standard of living. Therefore, Poland will probably have a low standard of living for the next fifty years.</p>

                                      This argument ignores the fact that Poland was part of the Soviet bloc during most of the past fifty years, and this fact accounts for its rather low standard of living. However, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Poland became an independent nation, and its economy is expected to improve steadily during the next fifty years.

                                       Yet another form of suppressed evidence is committed by arguers who quote passages out of context from sources such as the Bible, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights to support a conclusion that the passage was not intended to support. Consider, for example, the following argument against gun control:
                                     </p>

But a law controlling handguns would infringe the right to keep and bear arms. Therefore, a law controlling handguns would be unconstitutional.</p>

                                       In fact, the Second Amendment reads, “A well- regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” In other words, the amendment states that the right to bear arms shall not be infringed when the arms are necessary for the preservation of a well-regulated militia. Because a law controlling handguns (pistols) would have little effect on the preservation of a well-regulated militia, it is unlikely that such a law would be unconstitutional.

                                       The fallacies of ambiguity includes <strong>equivocation</strong> and <strong>amphiboly</strong>. These fallacies arise from the occurrence of some form of ambiguity in either the premises or the conclusion (or both). An expression is ambiguous if it is susceptible to different interpretations in a given context. When the conclusion of an argument depends on a shift in meaning of an ambiguous word or phrase or on the wrong interpretation of an ambiguous statement, the argument commits a fallacy of ambiguity.

                                           In the first argument, “obtuse” is used in two different senses. In the first premise it describes a certain kind of angle, while in the second it means dull or stupid.

                                             To be convincing, an argument that commits an equivocation must use the equivocal word in ways that are subtly related. Of the three examples given above, only the third might fulfill this requirement. Since both uses of the word “right” are related to ethics, the unalert observer may not notice the shift in meaning. Another technique is to spread the shift in meaning out over the course of a lengthy argument. Political speechmakers often use phrases such as “equal opportunity,” “gun control,” “national security,” and “environmental protection” in one way at the beginning of a speech and in quite another way at the end.

                                            The fallacy of <strong>amphiboly</strong> occurs when the arguer misinterprets an ambiguous statement and then draws a conclusion based on this faulty interpretation. The original statement is usually asserted by someone other than the arguer, and the ambiguity usually arises from a mistake in grammar or punctuation - a missing comma, a dangling modifier, an ambiguous antecedent of a pronoun, or some other careless arrangement of words. Because of this ambiguity, the statement may be understood in two clearly distinguishable ways. The arguer typically selects the unintended interpretation and proceeds to draw a conclusion based upon it. Here are some examples:

Mengistu is almost certain to argue that the gift of the clothes and the house should be shared equally by her and Lemma. Mrs. Zenebu could have avoided the dispute by adding either “respectively” or “collectively” to the end of the sentence.

                                              Amphiboly differs from equivocation in two important ways. First, equivocation is always traced to an ambiguity in the meaning of a word or phrase, whereas amphiboly involves a syntactical ambiguity in a statement.
                                            </p>

                                               The second difference is that amphiboly usually involves a mistake made by the arguer in interpreting an ambiguous statement made by someone else, whereas the ambiguity in equivocation is typically the arguer’s own creation. If these distinctions are kept in mind, it is usually easy to distinguish amphiboly from equivocation. Occasionally, however, the two fallacies occur together, as the following example illustrates:

But if “stewed” refers to the oysters it means “cooked,” and if it refers to the diners it means “intoxicated.” Thus, the argument also involves an equivocation.</p>

In other words, the fallacy occurs when it is argued that because the parts have a certain attribute, it follows that the whole has that attribute too and the situation is such that the attribute in question cannot be legitimately transferred from parts to whole.

Indeed, the fact that the atoms have mass is the very reason why the chalk has mass. The same reasoning extends to the fence. Thus, the acceptability of these arguments is attributable, at least in part, to the legitimate transference of an attribute from parts onto the whole.

                                               Further caution is required by the fact that composition is sometimes confused with hasty generalization. The only time this confusion is possible is when the “whole” is a class (such as the class of people in a city or the class of trees in a forest), and the “parts” are the members of the class. In such a case, composition proceeds from the members of the class to the class itself. Hasty generalization, on the other hand, proceeds from the specific to the general. Because it is sometimes easy to mistake a statement about a class for a general statement, composition can be mistaken for hasty generalization. Such a mistake can be avoided if one is careful to keep in mind the distinction between these two kinds of statements. This distinction falls back on the difference between the <strong>collective</strong> and the <strong>distributive</strong> predication of an attribute. Consider the following statements:
                                             </p>
                                              <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600">

The attribute of being small is predicated distributively; that is, it is assigned (or distributed) to each and every flea in the class. The second statement is a class statement. The attribute of being numerous is predicated collectively; that is, it is assigned not to the individual fleas but to the class of fleas. The meaning of the statement is not that each and every flea is numerous but that the class of fleas is large.</p>

Examine the conclusion of the argument. If the conclusion is a general statement—that is, a statement in which an attribute is predicated distributively to each and every member of a class—the fallacy committed is hasty generalization. But if the conclusion is a class statement—that is, a statement in which an attribute is predicated collectively to a class as a whole—the fallacy is composition.</p>

As with composition, this confusion can occur only when the “whole” is a class. In such a case, division proceeds from the class to the members, while accident proceeds from the general to the specific. Thus, if a class statement is mistaken for a general statement, division may be mistaken for accident. To avoid such a mistake, one should analyze the premises of the argument. If the premises contain a general statement, the fallacy committed is accident; but if they contain a class statement, the fallacy is division.

                                                A fallacy is a mistake in an argument that arises from something other than merely false premises. Usually fallacies involve defects in reasoning or the creation of an illusion that makes a bad argument appear good. Fallacies can be either formal or informal. A formal fallacy is one that can be detected by analyzing the form of an argument; such fallacies affect only deductive arguments. An informal fallacy is one that can be identified only by analyzing the content of an argument; such fallacies can affect both deductive and inductive arguments.

                                                 The fallacies of relevance occur when the premises of an argument are not relevant to the conclusion. Cases of such irrelevance occur in premises that threaten the observer, elicit pity from the observer, create a mob mentality in a group of observers, appeal to the observer’s desire for security, verbally abuse an opposing arguer, present an opposing arguer as predisposed to argue as he does, present an opposing arguer as a hypocrite, misapply a general rule, distort an opponent’s argument, or lead the arguer off the track. A kind of catch-all fallacy, missing the point, occurs when an arguer draws a conclusion different from the one implied by the premises. The fallacies of weak induction occur when the premises, although possibly relevant to the conclusion, provide insufficient support for the conclusion. Cases of such inadequate support occur when the arguer cites an authority who is not qualified, draws a conclusion from premises that give no positive evidence, draws a conclusion from an atypical sample, depends on a non - existent or minor causal connection, depends on a chain reaction that is unlikely to occur, or draws a conclusion from an analogy that is not close enough to support it.

                                                 The fallacies of presumption occur when the premises presume what they purport to prove. Such presumptions occur when the arguer creates the illusion that inadequate premises are adequate, asks a question that comprises two or more questions, uses a disjunctive statement that falsely claims to exhaust the available alternatives, or ignores important evidence that requires a different conclusion.
