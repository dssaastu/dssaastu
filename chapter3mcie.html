        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Chapter Three: Ethical Decision Making and Moral Judgments</h2>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">3.1 Chapter Introduction</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          One has to make decisions about which desire to satisfy and which to give up or postpone. How to make a right or correct decision and by what standard that one decision is right and another wrong is always a puzzle. One of the functions of morality is to give guidance in dealing with these puzzles.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          On the other hand, there are always conflicts among people. It is always a problem for a society to maintain order and to prevent or solve the conflicts among people reasonably. Another function of morality is to provide principles and rules that are acceptable to everyone and encourage people to live together peacefully and cooperatively. Many problems will arise in people's lives and in society.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          It is better to go back to the ethical theories to reflect upon the meaning and the end of morality and see what kind of principles can be a guide in taking action or in making moral judgments. One also needs to know why one should be moral. This chapter aims to introduce ethical decision making process and the need to be moral.

      <!-- Slide 2: Chapter Objectives -->
      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">3.2 Chapter Objectives</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-2">After reading this chapter, students will be able to:</p>
        <ul class="list-[circle] pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1">
          <li>Identify the moral foundations we base our ethical standards.</li>
          <li>Understand those standards how they applied to specific situations we face.</li>
          <li>Identify how good ethical decision made.</li>
          <li>Understand why we need to be moral.</li>

      <!-- Slide 3: How Can We Make Ethical Decisions? -->
      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">3.3 How Can We Make Ethical Decisions And Actions?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          In real life conditions we may get difficulties to always do the right thing. What we often considered as right and correct might put us in difficult condition with others and affect our social relation adversely. Individuals could give their own justification to testify that they are Right or correct!
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We often claim that we make right decision and actions. We regret when we make wrong decision and action. The ethical nature of our action and decision, however, is very much dependent upon our notion of 'Good' and 'Bad', 'Right and' 'wrong'. Before we see how human beings judge the morality of their actions, let raise some puzzling questions: What things are good or bad?
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          There are things which we consider good or desirable for their result-for what they lead to. There are also things which we consider good not because of what they lead to but because of what they are in themselves: this are considered as worth having or perusing not merely as way of getting other things but because of their own <strong>intrinsic nature</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          The first kind of good is called <strong>instrumental good</strong> because the goodness of these things lies in their being instruments towards the attainment of the other things which are considered good not simply as instruments. The second category of good is called <strong>intrinsic good</strong> because we value these things (whatever they may turn out to be) not for what they lead to but for what they are.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Slide 4: Good and Bad & Activity -->
      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Good and Bad: Instrumental vs. Intrinsic</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Have you ever think of the opposite. Yes, there are things which are instrumentally bad and intrinsically bad. Some things can fulfill both qualities. In our country things such as Female Genital Mutilation, early marriage, kidnapping, abduction, Ignorance, poverty, corruption, murder some of the things which are considered to be unethical or bad or evil practices which are to be eradicated.
        </p>
        <div class="activity-box">
            <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700">Activity:</p>
            <p class="italic text-gray-600">Would you give examples of the things instrumentally and intrinsically good and bad in a society you come from?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          One of the key tasks of ethical reasoning, generally, is to analyze and critically consider the values we hold and the claims we make in relation to the perceived obligations that we might have towards one another. Applied to the processes of death and dying and the care provided at end of life, key values that arise include sanctity of life (being alive is itself deeply valued), quality of life (positive experiences/avoiding negative ones is morally significant), autonomy (respecting preferences is morally significant and challenging).
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          A second key task of ethics is to evaluate the adequacy of reasons that we give for our actions: it considers, for example, whether the reasons offered are based on sound evidence and/or logical argument. Applied to death and dying, reasons evaluated might be arguments for resuscitating an incompetent patient or parents' reasons for refusing treatment for a disabled neonate.
        </p>
      </div>

       <!-- Slide 5: Weighing Values & Ethical Problems -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Weighing Values & Ethical Problems</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          The tasks of weighing ethical values and evaluating different ethical arguments are unlike many other kinds of human tasks. Ethical values are usually not as easy to understand as other kinds of values (e.g., practical value of energy vs. ethical value of courage). It is easier to test blood pressure than determine if someone is virtuous.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Moreover, ethical problems are often not as clear as other problems, and resolving them definitively is not always possible. The aim of ethics isn't to take the high moral ground and tell people what to do, but rather, to offer tools for thinking about difficult problems. Good ethical thinking seeks out the grey areas to acknowledge the diversity and complexity of roles, situations and circumstances in human life.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Despite complexity, there's an obligation on everyone in ethically-challenging situations to resolve problems sincerely, reasonably, and collaboratively. This means being prepared to review and revise one's position based on reflection, discussion, and changing circumstances.
          </p>
          <div class="activity-box">
            <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700">Activity:</p>
            <p class="italic text-gray-600">Form a group and list behaviors always right and always wrong. Record nominated but rejected behaviors and reasons why. Report final and rejected lists to the class. What do you conclude?</p>
          </div>
       </div>

      <!-- Slide 6: Ethical Principles & Rules of Thumb -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">3.3.1 Ethical Principles and Values of Moral Judgments</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          The branch of philosophical study focusing on ‘ethics' studies and builds coherent sets of 'rules' or principles for how people ought to live. The theoretical study isn't normally seen as necessary for everyday activities.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Instead of systematic frameworks, most people use day-to-day 'rules of thumb' that influence their behavior, such as ‘it is wrong to steal', ‘it is right to help people in need', and so on.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          But life's complexities sometimes test these simple rules. Consider "it is wrong to kill." Does this mean capital punishment is wrong? Killing animals? Self-defence? Termination of pregnancy? Euthanasia? Straightforward answers aren't always available.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          We need to examine these questions in detail, using theoretical frameworks to analyze complex problems and find rational, coherent solutions. While some do this individually, philosophers attempt to find general answers for everyone in society.
        </p>
        <div class="activity-box">
          <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700">Reflection:</p>
          <p class="italic text-gray-600">Think about a significant decision you made affecting others (good or bad). How did you decide? Was it based explicitly on right/wrong? Record justifications. Identify underlying principles/rules used (e.g., 'Best for my career', 'OK to lie to prevent hurt', 'Always help someone in difficulty').</p>
        </div>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 7: Moral Intuitions and Critical Reasoning -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">3.3.2 Moral intuitions and Critical Reasoning</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          The study of ethics involves reasoning about our feelings – making sense of and rationalising our intuitions about 'right' or 'good'. Almost all people experience empathy, which provides a sense of others' feelings and allows identification.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Empathy gives us moral sentiments (Traer, 2013); ethical reasoning about these gives us moral principles. The integration of these sentiments and principles is our conscience. Our moral conscience is based on emotions but should also be supported by reason.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          All societies have ethical ideas (attitudes, beliefs) and customs (notions of customary). Some are formalised in laws/regulations. These influence individual consciences. Philosophical ethics asks us to step back and critically reflect on these sentiments and attitudes.
        </p>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 8: Rationalisation -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">3.3.2.1 Rationalisation</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Studying ethics involves finding valid reasons for moral arguments. Most people have 'intuitions' or 'presumptions' about right/wrong. A philosophical approach requires critical thinking about these ideas, supporting/refuting them with convincing arguments, and articulating underlying reasons/assumptions.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          In moral philosophy, an argument focuses on the *reasons* behind beliefs/opinions, not just the beliefs themselves. The value isn't 'winning' but providing considered arguments and allowing rational understanding of underlying reasons. This requires careful listening, analysis, and learning from others' arguments.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          A common fault is <strong>rationalisation</strong>: using seemingly rational motives to cover true (perhaps unconscious) motives. Example: Landowner claims desire to create jobs drives building a recycling plant, when true motive is profit. This is rationalisation. If they state both profit and jobs as reasons, they may be giving two true motives.
        </p>
       </div>

        <!-- Slide 9: Types of Reasoning -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">3.3.2.2 Types of reasoning</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We can uncover errors using 'critical reasoning'. Three forms to justify arguments:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-3">
          <li>
            <strong>Reasoning by analogy:</strong> Explains by comparing to something similar but different. Good analogy: similarity outweighs dissimilarity, clarifies. Example: Animals are like/unlike humans. Is similarity strong enough to ascribe rights to nonhuman animals like humans?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deductive reasoning:</strong> Applies a principle to a situation. Example: If every person has human rights, and you are a person, then you have human rights.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inductive reasoning:</strong> Provides evidence to support a hypothesis. More evidence = more reliance. Example: Mounting evidence of fossil fuels' effect on climate supports argument for moral duty to reduce carbon emissions.
          </li>
        </ul>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 10: Ethics and Religious Faith -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">3.3.2.3 Ethics and Religious Faith</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Another important basis for ethical arguments is religious faith. For many, 'morality and religious faith go hand in hand'. Actions viewed as right/wrong based on divine commands, not rational arguments.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Some moral philosophers find faith-based arguments not rationally defensible, believing right/wrong determinable via rational reflection. If a god commands only what's right, divine commands seem unnecessary; we can know right/wrong through reason.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          However, faith-based arguments are relevant:
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
             <li>People don't always agree on right/wrong; unclear if reason alone suffices.</li>
             <li>Many people look to religion for guidance; don't underestimate religion's ability to persuade public to higher moral standards.</li>
             <li>While rational justification for principles/decisions may be insisted upon, religious arguments shouldn't be excluded from ethics study.</li>
          </ul>
          Accepting faith-based arguments as valid requires careful personal consideration.
        </p>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 11: Testing Moral Arguments -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">3.3.2.4 Testing moral arguments</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Critical reasoning involves asking questions about arguments: What kind of reasoning? (Deductive - principle rational? Inductive - evidence reliable?). Any hidden motives (rationalisations)? Conclusion logical given reasons?
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Rigorous criteria might seem off-putting. But most people already use critical reasoning. We have ideas of right/wrong from experience (presumptions), explained via feelings (intuitions) and reasons. Developing ability to test arguments (own and others') is important for personal, community, and organizational dilemmas.
        </p>
        <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Three ways to test a moral argument:</p>
         <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Factual accuracy:</strong> David Hume argued cannot derive 'ought' from 'is' (can't say something wrong/right just based on how things *are*). But ethical discussion needs factual accuracy. Example: If argument against aid to Africa is based on belief 90% goes to overhead, but factually 90% goes to poverty alleviation, the argument loses force.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consistency:</strong> Arguments must be consistent. Can only argue killing Person A is wrong but Person B acceptable if morally relevant difference exists. Example: If arguing poor nations' debts should be cancelled, must show moral difference if not also arguing all poor individuals' bank debts should be cancelled. Otherwise, inconsistent.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Good will:</strong> Most difficult to quantify. Arguments need to 'exemplify good will'. Involves intuitions/emotions, hard to integrate with theoretical debate.
            </li>
         </ol>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 12: Framework for Moral Decision Making -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">3.3.3 Thinking Ethically: A framework for Moral Decision Making</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          First step: <strong>Get the facts</strong>. Obvious but often overlooked. Moral controversies can arise from not checking facts. Facts alone tell us *what is*, not *what ought to be*.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Resolving ethical issues also requires appealing to <strong>values</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Ethics deals with right/wrong but doesn't always lead to consensus. Issues can be difficult for all viewpoints. Some situations are clearly wrong, others less so. Philosophers/teachers offer approaches to guide reflection. Five approaches to values: Fairness and Justice, Common Good, Utilitarian, Rights, Virtues.
        </p>
       </div>

        <!-- Slide 13: Fairness and Justice Approach -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">3.3.3.1 Fairness and Justice Approach</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Roots in Aristotle: “equals should be treated equally and unequal's unequally”. Basic question:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4 text-gray-700">
           <li>How fair is an action?</li>
           <li>Does it treat everyone same, or show favoritism/discrimination?</li>
        </ul>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Favoritism (benefits without justification) and discrimination (burdens on some but not similar others) are unjust/wrong.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Aristotle: Ethical knowledge general (like nutrition), not precise (like math). Practical discipline: become "good" by *being* virtuous, not just studying (like practicing football). Virtue found by establishing goals; ultimate goal = Highest Good = happiness. Not just pleasure/fame. Found "by ascertaining the specific function of man" - ability to reason (*logos*). Fulfilling this rational nature = happiness.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
            Humans categorized: virtuous, continent, incontinent, vicious. Approach focuses on fair distribution of benefits/burdens. Asks what's fair for all stakeholders. Fairness requires consistency. Principle: “Treat people the same unless there are morally relevant differences between them."
           </p>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 14: Common Good Approach -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">3.3.3.2 The Common Good Approach</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Greek philosophers: Life in community good in itself; actions should contribute. Interlocking societal relationships are basis of ethical reasoning. Respect/compassion for others (esp. vulnerable) required. Calls attention to common conditions vital for everyone's welfare (laws, police/fire, health care, education, recreation).
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Assumes society where individual good linked to community good. Members bound by common values/goals. Notion from Plato, Aristotle, Cicero. John Rawls: common good = "certain general conditions that are equally to everyone's advantage." Focus on ensuring social policies, systems, institutions, environments beneficial to all. Examples: affordable healthcare, public safety, peace, just legal system, unpolluted environment.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Appeals urge viewing selves as community members, reflecting on society desired. Respects individual freedom but challenges us to recognize/further shared goals. Vision of community joined in shared pursuit of common values. Principle: <strong>“What is ethical is what advances the common good."</strong>
        </p>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 15: Rights Approach -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">3.3.3.3 The Rights Approach</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Roots in 18th-century philosophy (Kant, etc.). Focused on individual's right to choose. Human dignity based on ability to choose freely; fundamental moral right to have choices respected. People not objects; violation of dignity to use them non-freely.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Many related rights stem from basic right to be treated as we choose. Examples:
          <ul class="list-[circle] pl-6 space-y-1">
             <li><strong>Right to the Truth:</strong> Right to be told truth/informed on matters affecting choices.</li>
             <li><strong>Right of Privacy:</strong> Right to do/believe/say what we choose in personal life (if not violating others' rights).</li>
             <li><strong>Right not to be injured:</strong> Right not to be harmed unless freely/knowingly deserve punishment or choose risk.</li>
             <li><strong>Right to what is agreed:</strong> Right to what was promised in freely entered contracts/agreements.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">
           Deciding morality: Ask, <strong>does the action respect the moral rights of everyone?</strong> Actions wrong if violate rights; more serious violation = more wrongful action.

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           The Rights Approach identifies interests/activities our behavior must respect (areas valuable enough to merit protection). Each person has fundamental right to be respected/treated as free, equal, rational person capable of own decisions. Implies other rights (privacy, free consent, freedom of conscience) needed for freedom to direct own life.

          Four aspects considered: religious morality, morality and nature, individual morality, social morality.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Refers to human relationship to supernatural being(s). Example: Jewish/Christian traditions - first three Ten Commandments pertain to God relationship, not other humans. Violating these could be immoral toward God without being immoral toward anyone else.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">3.4.2 Morality and Nature</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Refers to human relationship to nature. Prevalent in primitive cultures (Native American) and Far East. Western tradition now also recognizes significance. Some see nature valuable only for humanity; others see intrinsic value worthy of moral consideration. Implies Robinson Crusoe *could* act morally/immorally alone towards nature.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">3.4.3 Individual Morality</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Refers to individuals in relation to themselves; individual code maybe not sanctioned by society/religion. Allows for "higher morality" within individual conscience. Person might act based on own sense of right/wrong, not external rules.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">3.4.4 Social Morality</h3>
         <p class="text-gray-600">
           Concerns human relation to other humans. Probably most important aspect, cuts across others, found in most ethical systems. Robinson Crusoe incapable of significant moral/immoral action except toward self/nature. Action minimal compared to potential if others present whom he could subjugate/torture/destroy. Many systems allow what one does to self is own business if "doesn't harm anyone else."

       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">3.5 Who is Morally/Ethically Responsible?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Morality pertains only to human beings; attributing to supernatural requires faith. Holding animals/plants morally responsible ignores scientific evidence of instinct, own observations.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Recent experiments teaching language to animals suggest minimal thought process capacity; maybe morality could be taught in future. Then animals could be held responsible. Currently, evidence indicates animals/plants non-moral or amoral (no moral sense / outside moral sphere).
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Therefore, terms 'moral'/'ethical' used reference only humans. Wolf not morally responsible for killing sheep; eagle for chicken. We kill predator wolf/fox not because morally responsible, but to prevent more loss. Only humans currently moral/immoral; only humans held morally responsible.

       <!-- Slide 20: Moral Judgments -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">3.5.1 Moral Judgments</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Refer to deciding right/wrong in human relations. Individuals continually judge own/others' conduct. Approve acts as right/good; condemn others as wrong/evil/bad.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Moral judgments always concern human actions, particularly <strong>voluntary actions</strong> (freely chosen). Involuntary actions (no control) rarely open to moral judgment (not responsible if didn't initiate).
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Judgments are <strong>evaluative</strong> (place value, determine right/wrong) and <strong>normative</strong> (assess moral worth based on norms/standards).
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Choosing right course not always simple. No algorithm; rule application needs judgment. Onora O'Neill: principles not auto-pilot; judgment always needed in using/following/flouting rules. Conflicts require sensitivity, experience, discernment, intelligence, goodwill; even then doubt remains.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">Judging conduct considers: motives, means, consequences, sometimes situation.</p>
       </div>

       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Factors in Moral Judgment (1)</h2>
         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">1. Motives:</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Basic for morality (Jesus, Kant). Refers to *intention* or *why* action done. Good motive prerequisite for unqualified approval. If good motive leads to harm via unforeseen factor, disapprove less ("Anyway, he meant well.").
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Kant: Good = good will. "Nothing... good without qualification, except a good will." Rational being strives for *ought*, distinct from inclination/self-interest. Must act *out of duty* to moral law. Truly moral act agrees with law AND done *for sake of* law (*because* duty requires). Seat of moral worth is individual's will; good will acts from sense of duty.
          </p>
         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">2. Means:</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Agency, instrument, method used to attain end. Expect best available means. Condemn if means unjust/cruel/immoral. Rarely, approve acts using normally condemned means. Danger in proposing *any* means usable if end good (end justifies means). Once chosen, means become part of act's general effect.
          </p>

         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">3. Consequences:</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Effects/results of moral decision based on value. Expect consequences of "right" act to be good. "What is right?" often means thinking about consequences. Depends on ethical principle (Kant: good motive; Utilitarians: result).
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Society judges conduct "right" if proceeds from good motive, via best means, to good consequences. If conditions unmet, condemn or approve with reservations. Rarely approve if results evil/wrong.
         </p>
         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">4. The Moral Situation:</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Involves moral agents (humans acting, making choices/decisions consciously). Demands placed on us: obligations (duties/rights). Faced with moral alternatives; weigh better with understanding of ingredients.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6 text-gray-700">3.5.2 What Makes an Action Moral?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Sometimes 'moral' means morally good. Philosophically: action within scope of morality (morally significant, positive or negative). Not all actions have moral sense (raincoat, sharpening pencil = morally neutral/non-moral). Stealing, punching, helping disadvantaged = morally significant.
          </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Features of a Moral Action</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            <strong>A. A moral act involves an agent:</strong> Natural events or animal actions are morally neutral. Humans (or creatures capable of free, thoughtful choice) are moral agents.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           <strong>B. A moral act involves intention:</strong> Motives crucial for rightness/wrongness. Accidental action may be morally neutral. Unintentional acts via negligence can be moral (neglecting duties = morally culpable).
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           <strong>C. A moral act affects others:</strong> Needs agent, deliberation, AND needs to affect others (moral patients) significantly (harmful or beneficial consequences).
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Claim morality *only* governs behavior affecting others is controversial. Some claim affects only agent (drugs, masturbation, not developing talents) also moral. Confusion arises from not distinguishing morality/religion. Self-affecting behavior as moral supported by idea of obeying God's commands (religious holdover?). May affect views on homosexuality (moral if distinguished from religion?).
          </p>
          <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Generally, a moral action is one which:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1">
             <li>Is performed by agents (capable of free will/choice).</li>
             <li>Is the result of intention (done on purpose with motive).</li>
             <li>Has significant consequence on others (harm or benefits).</li>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Worthwhile question: Why be good/do right rather than bad/wrong? Assuming no supernatural morality, any other reasons?
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          No society without moral regulation; humans are social beings.

         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">A. Argument from Enlightened Self-Interest</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Generally better to be good than bad, create good world. Self-interest sole basis of ethical egoism. Argument here isn't *pursue* self-interest, but if *everyone* tried to be good, it would be in *everyone's* self-interest. Example: If group doesn't kill/steal/lie/cheat, each benefits. Individual might say: "In my self-interest to be good; I benefit, and avoid punishment." Compelling, though not airtight.
         </p>
          <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">B. Argument from Tradition and Law</p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
             Traditions/laws established over time govern behavior, urging morality. Good reasons to be moral: self-interest, plus respect for human thought/effort establishing these norms. Attractive argument, but tends to suppress questioning (core of creative moral reasoning). Most likely learned morality via this, religious argument, experiences.

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Examining human nature empirically/rationally reveals common needs, desires, goals (friendship, love, happiness, freedom, peace, creativity, stability for self/others). To satisfy needs, must establish/follow moral principles encouraging cooperation, freeing from fear (losing life, mutilation, theft, lies, cheating, restriction, imprisonment).

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 italic">
             "Morality is not of course identical with following self-interest. If it were, there could be no conflict between morality and self-interest and no point in having rules overriding self-interest." - John Hospers
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Morality exists partly due to human needs, recognizing importance of cooperative living. May not convince everyone to be moral, or always be in individual self-interest.

         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Common answers:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 mb-4">

             Good answers, powerful motivations for some (religious faith, parental responsibility). But won't apply to everyone (nonbelievers, nonparents, those lacking self-respect or thinking they can escape punishment).

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Morality is social; irrelevant in isolation. Appears with second person. Set of rules enabling collective goals. Imagine society without moral rules.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            "Why should *I* be moral?" is complex (Cooperate vs Cheat game). Ultimately, be moral because occasionally allowing disadvantage yields overall long-term advantage. Even if seems possible to break rules without consequence, consistent following needed because *complete moral form of life* (where act rooted) not against self-interest, even if individual act sometimes is.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Ethical reasoning vital. Offers rationale/impetus for ethical structure. Theories/principles are foundations of ethical analysis, viewpoints for guidance.

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Decision maker needs procedure ensuring rationality/respect, considering all factors and others' interests. Habit of pursuing justice needed. Aristotle: moral practice vital. Cannot have moral character without constant practice (like pianist needing practice).
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
             Giving up benefits for morality requires knowing *why* be moral / why it's good. Like taking medicine: need to know it promotes health. Moral theory shows significance/good of morality. Focus on *why* be moral, and *what* principles to observe.
