                    <p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper examines the recent developments surrounding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and its implications for Ethiopia-Egypt relations, with Somalia emerging as a central point of the conflict zone. Egypt's historical involvement in Middle East conflicts, particularly regarding the Gaza conflict, highlights its significant role in regional diplomacy. However, Egypt's stance on the GERD reveals a contradictory position: while it remains relatively passive in supporting Palestinians nearby, it emphasizes its historical rights over the Nile and simultaneously supports Somalia which is both geographically distant yet strategically relevant. This dynamic raises questions about Egypt's motivations and priorities. Ethiopia, grappling with internal challenges, must effectively navigate these complexities to counter external threats. The current situation necessitates a shift in Egypt's approach; rather than clinging to historical claims; it should adopt a win-win principle that promotes equitable resource sharing from the Nile River. The methodology employed in this study primarily involves news analysis from various media outlets, providing a comprehensive understanding of the evolving dynamics surrounding the GERD and its broader implications for regional relations.

                    <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) has become a significant source of tension between Ethiopia and Egypt, profoundly influencing their bilateral relations. The GERD is located in Ethiopia's Benishangul-Gumuz region, near the Sudanese border, and it plays a crucial role in Ethiopia's socioeconomic development and national energy needs. Egypt, as a downstream nation heavily dependent on Nile waters for agriculture and drinking supply, views the dam as a significant threat to its water security. Sudan occupies a strategic position between the two, facing both potential benefits from the dam's electricity generation and risks related to flooding. Although Somalia is not directly adjacent to the Nile, its involvement highlights broader regional security concerns, particularly regarding resource management and the potential spillover effects of tensions between Ethiopia and Egypt. Understanding these dynamics is essential for comprehending the complex interplay of interests among these nations in the context of ongoing geopolitical conflicts.</p>
                    <p>This paper explores recent developments related to the GERD and their implications for Ethiopia-Egypt relations, with Somalia emerging as a central conflict zone. The Nile River is shared by ten countries, including Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia, but in 1959, Egypt and Sudan signed an agreement that allocated the river's water resources exclusively to themselves, leaving limited rights for other riparian states. For Ethiopia, constructing the GERD is a crucial strategy to meet its developmental needs and assert its rights over the Nile. However, this initiative has escalated disputes involving Egypt and Sudan, as Egypt fears that the dam will reduce its access to essential water resources.</p>
                    <p>Historically, Egypt has played a vital role in Middle Eastern conflicts; however, its silence regarding the situation in Gaza raises questions about its influence in regional diplomacy. This stance appears contradictory, as Egypt seeks to uphold its historical claims over the Nile waters while simultaneously supporting Somalia a nation that is geographically distant but strategically significant for regional stability. The deployment of Egyptian troops in Somalia is perceived as part of a broader geopolitical rivalry with Ethiopia regarding the GERD. As Ethiopia faces internal challenges, it must navigate these complexities to counter external threats effectively. The current situation necessitates a shift in Egypt's approach; instead of clinging to historical claims, it should adopt a win-win principle that promotes equitable resource sharing from the Nile River. This perspective is essential for fostering cooperation and ensuring long-term stability in the region.</p>

                    <h2 id="methodology">2. Research Methodology</h2>
                    <p>This study primarily involves news analysis from various media outlets, providing a comprehensive overview of the evolving dynamics surrounding the GERD and its broader implications for regional relations. The qualitative analysis involves examining the language, tone, and framing used in news reports to understand how issues are presented to various audiences. The approach is both multifaceted and comprehensive, addressing the complex interplay of geopolitical dynamics, historical context, and the various interests of the involved parties. By examining these interconnections, this paper aims to clarify the complexities of Ethiopia-Egypt interactions and propose potential pathways toward resolution amidst escalating tensions.</p>

                    <h2 id="egypt-middle-east">3. Egypt's Role in the Middle East Conflicts</h2>
                    <p>Egypt has historically served as a mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, particularly during periods of heightened violence. The recent escalation following the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, has positioned Egypt in a pivotal role. The Egyptian government is apprehensive about a possible influx of refugees from Gaza into its territory, especially in the Sinai Peninsula, which could worsen existing security issues.</p>
                    <p>In light of the conflict in Gaza, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has advocated for allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza while firmly rejecting any proposals to transfer Palestinian refugees into Egypt. This position underscores Egypt's intent to uphold its sovereignty and internal stability while also addressing humanitarian needs. Egypt has opened the Rafah crossing to facilitate aid but remains cautious about permitting large numbers of refugees to enter. Egypt's diplomatic initiatives include proposing a ceasefire plan developed in collaboration with Qatar. This plan seeks a phased release of hostages held by Hamas alongside Palestinian prisoners in Israeli detention. However, the effectiveness of these efforts is hindered by the complex realities on the ground and the differing interests of regional actors. Currently, Egypt's role in the Gaza conflict appears limited to calls for humanitarian assistance, leading to perceptions among its Arab counterparts that Egypt is an unreliable partner. By not adopting a more assertive position on this matter, Egypt claims it is prioritizing assistance to Somalia, a member of the Arab League. This strategy has faced criticism, as many argue that Egypt should be more actively involved in resolving the humanitarian crisis in Gaza instead of focusing on its engagement with Somalia.</p>

                    <h2 id="gerd-dispute">4. Egypt's Dispute with Ethiopia on GERD</h2>
                    <p>The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) has been a significant source of tension between Egypt and Ethiopia. The Nile River is crucial for Egypt's water supply, providing approximately 95% of its freshwater resources. As Ethiopia continues to fill the dam unilaterally, Egypt perceives this as an existential threat to its water security. Recently, significant developments have occurred regarding the Nile River and its management, particularly with the Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA), also known as the Entebbe Agreement. On October 13, 2024, the CFA officially came into force after South Sudan's accession, which was a critical step in establishing a legal framework for equitable water resource management among Nile Basin countries. The agreement allows upstream nations to implement projects along the Nile without requiring consent from downstream countries like Egypt and Sudan, which has led to renewed tensions. Egypt's Irrigation Minister has called for a reconsideration of the CFA, emphasizing that it undermines Egypt's water security, as the Nile provides over 98% of its freshwater resources. This situation highlights ongoing conflicts and differing interests among the Nile Basin states, particularly as they navigate issues related to the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and its implications for regional cooperation.</p>
                    <blockquote>The agreement allows upstream nations to implement projects along the Nile without requiring consent from downstream countries like Egypt and Sudan, which has led to renewed tensions.</blockquote>
                    <p>Ethiopia presents several key arguments to justify the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) project. Firstly, the GERD is viewed as essential for meeting the country's economic and development needs, particularly in addressing its acute energy shortage. With over 62% of Ethiopians lacking access to electricity, the dam is expected to generate more than 5 gigawatts of hydroelectric power, significantly increasing Ethiopia's electricity generation capacity and facilitating plans for 100% electrification by 2025. Additionally, the GERD is projected to enable Ethiopia to become a major electricity exporter, potentially earning up to $1 billion annually from exports to neighboring countries.</p>

                    <h2 id="egypt-contradiction">5. Egypt's Self-Contradictory Position</h2>
                    <p>Egypt views stability in Somalia as essential for regional security and has engaged in diplomatic efforts to support peace initiatives while addressing humanitarian needs. However, Somalia is geographically distant from Egypt, raising questions about why Egypt prioritizes this relationship over its immediate concerns with Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda, which directly impact their security due to their neighboring relationships. From the Egyptian perspective, remaining silent on the Gaza issue while actively protecting Somalia—a member of the Arab League—appears paradoxical and self-contradictory to many observers.</p>
                    <p>In stark contrast to its muted response to the Gaza conflict, Egypt has actively engaged in Somalia, signing a military cooperation agreement that includes deploying troops as part of an African Union peacekeeping mission. This move is seen as part of Egypt's broader strategy to enhance its influence in the Horn of Africa amid rising tensions with Ethiopia over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD).</p>
                    <p>In August 2024, Egypt and Somalia signed a defense pact aimed at bolstering security cooperation between the two nations. This agreement was formalized during a visit by Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud to Egypt and is described as a "historic" pact. Under this pact, Egypt plans to send up to 10,000 troops to Somalia as part of a new African Union-led peacekeeping mission, marking Egypt's first significant military involvement in the region since the early 1960s. The military engagement in Somalia is perceived as a strategic maneuver to counter Ethiopia's growing influence in the Horn of Africa, particularly following Ethiopia's agreement with Somaliland to establish a naval base. This deployment aims to deter potential Ethiopian encroachment and enhance Somalia's military capabilities against threats such as al-Shabaab.</p>
                    <p>The local opposition in Somalia to Egyptian involvement is driven by several key concerns. Many Somalis view the presence of Egyptian forces as a direct threat to their national sovereignty and regional stability. Protests have erupted across major cities, with demonstrators holding signs that read "We Don't Need Egypt!" and "We Need Ethiopia!" This sentiment reflects a widespread belief that replacing Ethiopian troops with Egyptian forces could jeopardize the fragile security gains achieved in the fight against Al-Shabaab militants.</p>

                    <h2 id="ethiopia-internal-conflicts">6. Resolving Internal Conflicts in Ethiopia to Address External Threats</h2>
                    <p>The current conflict in Ethiopia is characterized by a complex interplay of internal strife and external pressures, particularly in the context of rising Egyptian influence. Following the Tigray War, which lasted from November 2020 to November 2022 and resulted in significant loss of life and displacement, Ethiopia has been grappling with renewed violence involving militia groups from the Amhara and Oromia regions.</p>
                    <p>In this context, Ethiopia's ability to counter Egyptian influence hinges on its success in resolving these internal conflicts through peaceful means. The Ethiopian government has faced criticism for its handling of regional militias and ethnic tensions. The ongoing violence not only undermines national stability but also complicates Ethiopia's diplomatic efforts to address external threats, including those posed by Egypt's military involvement in Somalia.</p>
                    <blockquote>Ethiopia must prioritize dialogue and reconciliation among its diverse ethnic groups to combat external influence and stabilize its position in the Horn of Africa.</blockquote>
                    <p>To effectively combat Egyptian influence and stabilize its position in the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia must prioritize dialogue and reconciliation among its diverse ethnic groups. This approach would not only foster national unity but also enhance Ethiopia's diplomatic leverage in regional affairs. Peaceful resolution of internal conflicts is essential for establishing a cohesive front against external pressures and ensuring long-term stability in the region.</p>

                    <h2 id="egypt-stabilizing-role">7. Egypt's Role in Stabilizing the Current Situation with Ethiopia</h2>
                    <p>From Egypt's perspective, shifting public attention towards the Nile issue is no longer a sustainable approach to solve the internal situation. There is a pressing need for a strategic pivot towards dialogue with Ethiopia, aimed at fostering mutual development and addressing the ongoing Nile River conflict. Engaging in constructive discussions is essential for Egypt to redirect public focus from domestic challenges and build a cooperative relationship with Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p>To stabilize the current situation with Ethiopia regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Egypt should consider several strategic recommendations. First, Egypt should prioritize diplomatic engagement by actively participating in negotiations with Ethiopia and Sudan, fostering a collaborative dialogue that emphasizes mutual benefits and regional stability. This could involve seeking mediation from neutral third parties or international organizations to facilitate discussions.</p>
                    <p>Second, Egypt can enhance its public diplomacy efforts to effectively communicate its concerns regarding water security with Ethiopia. By raising awareness of the potential impacts of the GERD on its water supply, Egypt can garner support from both Ethiopian citizens and the international community while also addressing domestic concerns. Moreover, Egypt should explore economic cooperation initiatives with Ethiopia, focusing on shared interests such as trade, infrastructure development, and environmental sustainability. By creating interdependencies, both nations may find common ground that mitigates tensions.</p>

                    <h2 id="western-involvement">8. Western Involvement in Resolving the Current Conflict</h2>
                    <p>In the conflict between Ethiopia and Egypt, Western nations can play a significant role in resolving their dispute, provided they remain impartial and genuinely aim to address the concerns of both countries. At the same time, the West must seriously consider Egypt's involvement in Somalia, which may be intended to either combat or create a psychological threat to Ethiopia. The current situation poses various challenges for Western interests, including geopolitical stability, counterterrorism efforts, water security, and humanitarian concerns.</p>
                    <p>The assertion that former President Donald Trump was attempting to mediate between Egypt and Ethiopia regarding the GERD is indeed partial. Trump's comments during a press conference in October 2020 suggested a dramatic stance, implying that Egypt might resort to extreme measures against the dam. He stated, “It's a very dangerous situation because Egypt is not going to be able to live that way... They will end up blowing up the dam". This statement not only reflects Trump's frustration with Ethiopia's actions but also indicates a lack of a balanced diplomatic approach.</p>
                    <p>Ethiopia's reaction to former President Donald Trump's remarks was one of strong condemnation and concern. Ethiopia's Foreign Minister summoned the U.S. Ambassador to Ethiopia to seek clarification on Trump's statements, stating that such comments "neither reflect the longstanding partnership and strategic alliance between Ethiopia and the United States nor are acceptable in International Law governing interstate relations." Overall, Ethiopia viewed Trump's remarks as a dangerous escalation that undermined diplomatic efforts and threatened regional stability.</p>

                    <h2 id="conclusion">9. Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Egypt's position in the current Middle Eastern conflicts is shaped by its historical role as a mediator, its geographical significance concerning water security with Ethiopia, its engagement in Somalia for regional stability, and its leadership within the Arab League. As tensions continue to escalate across the region, Egypt must navigate complex domestic pressures while striving to maintain its strategic alliances and address humanitarian concerns arising from ongoing conflicts.</p>
                    <p>Egypt's dual approach—remaining largely silent on the Gaza conflict while actively engaging militarily in Somalia—highlights contradictions within its role as a member of the Arab League. While Egypt seeks to present itself as a leader advocating for Palestinian rights, its actions in Somalia suggest a prioritization of national interests over collective Arab solidarity. This contradictory stance could have significant implications for Egypt's relationships within the Arab League.</p>
                    <p>Ethiopia must address its internal conflicts to prevent foreign exploitation, while Egypt should engage with Ethiopia based on mutual benefit. Additionally, Western nations need to play an impartial role in facilitating a resolution to the disputes between the two countries. In summary, Egypt and Ethiopia should seek a peaceful resolution to their differences, focusing on creating a win-win situation for both parties.</p>
