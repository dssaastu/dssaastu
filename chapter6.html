           Dear students, it is clear that the discussions so far, in the previous chapters, provide you clue insights to what it means, in logic, <strong>categorical</strong> and <strong>proposition</strong>. A proposition that relates two classes, or categories, is called a <strong>categorical proposition</strong>.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">
           The classes in question are denoted respectively by the subject term and the predicate term, and the proposition asserts that either all or part of the class denoted by the subject term is included in or excluded from the class denoted by the predicate term. To put the same ideas in different words, a categorical proposition is a statement that relates two sets, classes, groups or categories which are presented in their subject or predicate positions that could be connected based on inclusion (partial/whole) or exclusion (partial/whole) relations.

           <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">What is Categorical Propositions?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Dear learners, the term category or categorical, in this respect, refers to set of things, such as, human beings, animals, plants, workers, ladies, and so on. In a categorical proposition, these and other set of things appears in the subject and predicate part of a proposition. The term proposition refers to the information content or meaning of a statement. However, to avoid inconvenience, we can use the terms statement and proposition interchangeably for this purpose.
            </p>
             <p class="text-gray-600">
               Categorical propositions are in general simple, easy or plain statements that relate two classes of things based on the rule of exclusion or inclusion principles.
             </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 mt-4">Here are some examples of categorical propositions:</p>
              <ul class="arrow-list pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1">
                <li>Every human being is mortal</li>
                <li>Nothing that is a human which is eternal</li>
                <li>There exists a fish that is a shark.</li>
                <li>There are plants which are not edible.</li>
              </ul>
           </div>

           <div class="slide">
             <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">What is Categorical Propositions? (Continued)</h2>
             <p class="text-gray-600">All the above statements are categorical propositions. This is due to the fact that in each statement two sets of things are related either in the form of inclusion or exclusion. In the first example, two set of things are given: human being (which is the subject of the statement) and mortal (the predicate of the statement). And we see that these two classes (human beings and mortal beings) are related based on inclusion relation, that is, without exception all human beings are included part of in the class of mortal beings. This proposition is contrary to the third proposition, because it says that human beings are not belonged (not included) in to the class of eternal beings. This is to say that human beings are entirely excluded from the class of eternal beings.</p>

              <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                In all the above cases, there are certain difficulties. The amount of the set of things is not clearly stated based on fixed quantifiers. It is very difficult to determine the type of relation of the two classes in the form of inclusion or exclusion. It is ambiguous to decide the attribute (nature) of statements either negatively or positively and to determine their logical relation with other statements. These and other related problems urge us to study categorical propositions based on fixed logical standard-forms.
              </p>
               <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                 Since any categorical proposition asserts that either all or part of the class denoted by the subject term is included in or excluded from the class denoted by the predicate term, it follows that there are exactly four types of categorical propositions:
               </p>
               <ul class="arrow-list pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1">
                 <li>Those that assert that the whole subject class is included in the predicate class</li>
                 <li>Those that assert that part of the subject class is included in the predicate class</li>
                 <li>Those that assert that the whole subject class is excluded from the predicate class</li>
                 <li>Those that assert that part of the subject class is excluded from the predicate class.</li>

               Dear learners, to determine the validity and invalidity of the immediate inferences of categorical statements and to identify the formal fallacies committed in invalid arguments based on the criteria of logical rules, categorical propositions should be stated in standard form. A categorical proposition that expresses these relations with complete clarity is called a <strong>standard-form categorical proposition</strong>.

                 Dear learners, We have defined Proposition in the technical sense, as the meaning or information content of a statement. Note that: For the purposes of this course, “proposition” and “statement” are used interchangeably.” Thus for the purpose of this course we will use “proposition” and “statement” interchangeably.

                A proposition or statement is a sentence that is either true or false. This being the case, categorical proposition is defined as a proposition that relates two classes, or categories. The classes in question are denoted respectively by the subject term and the predicate term. The proposition asserts that either all or part of the class denoted by the subject term is included in or excluded from the class denoted by the predicate term.

               <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                 Accordingly, we have four propositions and each of these propositions has quantifier, subject term, sentential connective and predicate term. These are, in general, known as the components of a categorical proposition. Study the following points.

                 <li>Copula = ‘Are’ and are ‘not’. The Latin copula is a sentential connective that relates the subject and predicate terms.</li>

                      The concept of <strong>distribution</strong> emphasizes the terms (the subject & predicate terms) and not the proposition as such. If a term refers unambiguously the set of things stated in it entirely the term is said to be distributed. It implies that attribute of the class is distributed to each & every member of the class and we know clearly that the attribute is shared similarly by every member of the class. If a term does not state the class of things in this way, the term is said to be undistributed. Study the following table:

                     The primary goal of our inquiry into categorical propositions is to disclose the role that such propositions play in the formation of arguments. Accordingly, in such interpretations, an argument might be valid or invalid. The standard forms of categorical statements can be represented in diagrams. The first known diagram of categorical propositions is called <strong>Euler diagram</strong>, after the 18th mathematician L. Euler. Later on, however, Euler diagram was found to be ineffective in identifying valid & invalid categorical syllogistic arguments and thereby new diagram for categorical propositions become indispensable.

                      Adopting this interpretation of categorical propositions, the nineteenth-century logician John Venn developed a system of diagrams to represent the information they express. These diagrams have come to be known as <strong>Venn diagrams</strong>. Venn diagram is an arrangement of overlapping circles in which each circle represents the class denoted by a term in a categorical proposition. Because every categorical proposition has exactly two terms, the Venn diagram for a single categorical proposition consists of two overlapping circles. Each circle is labeled so that it represents one of the terms in the proposition.

                     <p class="text-gray-600">Unless otherwise required, we adopt the convention that the left-hand circle represents the subject term, and the right-hand circle of the predicate term. In such a diagram:</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Dear students, to understand the modern and traditional square of opposition, let us compare the diagram for the A proposition with the diagram for the O proposition. The diagram for the A proposition asserts that the left -hand part of the S circle is empty, whereas the diagram for the O proposition asserts that this same area is not empty. These two diagrams make assertions that are the exact opposite of each other. As a result, their corresponding statements are said to contradict each other. Analogously, the diagram for the E proposition asserts that the area where the two circles overlap is empty, whereas the diagram for the I proposition asserts that the area where the two circles overlap is not empty. Accordingly, their corresponding propositions are also said to contradict each other.</p>

Thus, if a certain A proposition is given as true, the corresponding E proposition is false (because at least one must be false), and if an E proposition is given as true, the corresponding A proposition is false.

In this case, the E proposition has logically undetermined truth value.</p>
                      <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">In the previous sections, we have adopted the Boolean standpoint, and we saw how the modern square of opposition applies regardless of whether the propositions refer to actually existing things. In this , we adopt the Aristotelian standpoint, which recognizes that universal propositions about existing things have existential import. For such propositions, the traditional square of opposition becomes applicable. Like the modern square, the traditional square of opposition is an arrangement of lines that illustrates logically necessary relations among the four kinds of categorical propositions. However, because the Aristotelian standpoint recognizes the additional factor of existential import, the traditional square supports more inferences than does the modern square.</p>

                        Similarly, if an E proposition is given as false, the corresponding A proposition has logically undetermined truth value. These results are borne out in ordinary language. Thus, if we are given the actually true A proposition “All cats are animals,” the corresponding E proposition “No cats are animals” is false, and if we are given the actually true E proposition “No cats are dogs,” the corresponding A proposition “All cats are dogs” is false. Thus, the A and E propositions cannot both be true. However, they can both be false. “All animals are cats” and “No animals are cats” are both false.

But if either an I or an O proposition is given as true, then the corresponding proposition could be either true or false without violating the “at least one is true” rule.

                         The sub alternation relation is represented by two arrows: a downward arrow marked with the letter T (true), and an upward arrow marked with an F (false). These arrows can be thought of as pipelines through which truth values flow. The downward arrow “transmits” only truth, and the upward arrow only falsity. Thus, if an A proposition is given as true, the corresponding I proposition is true also, and if an I proposition is given as false, the corresponding A proposition is false. But if an A proposition is given as false, this truth value cannot be transmitted downward, so the corresponding I proposition will have logically undetermined truth value. Conversely, if an I proposition is given as true, this truth value cannot be transmitted upward, so the corresponding A proposition will have logically undetermined truth value. Analogous reasoning prevails for the sub alternation relation between the E and O propositions. To remember the direction of the arrows for sub alternation, imagine that truth “trickles down,” and falsity “floats” up.

                         Dear learners, Since the modern square of opposition provides logically necessary results, we can use it to test certain arguments for validity. We begin by assuming the premise is true, and we enter the pertinent truth value in the square. We then use the square to compute the truth value of the conclusion. If the square indicates that the conclusion is true, the argument is valid; if not, the argument is invalid.

                            <p>Some trade spies are not masters at bribery.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, it is false that all trade spies are masters at bribery.</p>
                          </div>
                         <p class="text-gray-600">To evaluate this argument, we begin by assuming that the premise, which is an O proposition, is true, and we enter this truth value in the square of opposition. We then use the square to compute the truth value of the corresponding A proposition. By the contradictory relation, the A proposition is false. Since the conclusion claims that the A proposition is false, the conclusion is true, and therefore the argument is valid.</p>

                           Arguments that are valid from the Boolean standpoint are said to be <strong>unconditionally valid</strong> because they are valid regardless of whether their terms refer to existing things.

                          <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">Note that the conclusion of this argument has the form “It is false that all S are P.” Technically, statements of this type are not standard-form propositions because, among other things, they do not begin with a quantifier. To remedy this difficulty we adopt the convention that statements having this form are equivalent to “‘All S are P’ is false.” Analogous remarks apply to the negations of the E, I, and O statements.</p>

                         <p class="text-gray-600">We can also use Venn diagrams to test immediate inferences for validity. However, using this technique often requires that we diagram statements beginning with the phrase “It is false that.” Let us begin by showing how to diagram such statements. Here are two examples:</p>
                          <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600 mt-4">
                            <p>It is false that all A are B.</p>
                            <p>It is false that some A are B.</p>
                          </div>
                          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Any statement that is diagrammed by entering an X in an area is a particular proposition. Thus, as the diagram shows, “It is false that all A are B” is actually a particular proposition. By similar reasoning, “It is false that no A are B” is also a particular proposition. To diagram “It is false that some A are B,” we do the exact opposite of what we would do to diagram “Some A are B.” For “Some A are B,” we would enter an X in the overlap area. Thus, to diagram “It is false that some A are B,” we shade the overlap area:</p>

                          <p class="text-gray-600">Here, the conclusion diagram asserts that the overlap area is empty. Since this information is not contained in the premise diagram, the inference is <strong>invalid</strong>. We conclude with a special kind of inference that: the information of the conclusion diagram is not contained in the premise diagram, so the inference is invalid. However, if the premise were interpreted as having existential import, then the C circle in the premise diagram would not be empty. Specifically, there would be members in the overlap area. This would make the inference valid.</p>
                           <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">Arguments of this sort are said to commit the <strong>existential fallacy</strong>. From the Boolean standpoint, the <strong>existential fallacy</strong> is a formal fallacy that occurs whenever an argument is invalid merely because the premise lacks existential import. Such arguments always have a universal premise and a particular conclusion. The fallacy consists in attempting to derive a conclusion having existential import from a premise that lacks it.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600">Finally, while all of these forms proceed from a universal premise to a particular conclusion, it is important to see that not every inference having a universal premise and a particular conclusion commits the existential fallacy. For example, the inference “All A are B; therefore, some A are not B” does not commit this fallacy. This inference is invalid because the conclusion contradicts the premise. Thus, to detect the existential fallacy, one must ensure that the invalidity results merely from the fact that the premise lacks existential import. This can easily be done by constructing a Venn diagram.</p>

You have to know that fallacies are mistakes committed in arguments which deludes us into thinking that the mistaken argument as correct one. They are classified as formal and informal fallacies. Informal fallacies can be detected by examining the logical problem in the argument, while formal fallacies can be known simply by their logically incorrect forms that are by the position of terms, quantifiers and statements.</p>

Also, these pairs of diagrams are not the exact opposite of each other, as is the case with contradictory statements. This means that an A statement and its converse are logically unrelated as to truth value, and an O statement and its converse are logically unrelated as to truth value. In other words, converting an ‘A’ or ‘O’ statement gives a new statement whose truth value is logically undetermined in relation to the given statement. The converse of an A or O statement does have a truth value, of course, but logic alone cannot tell us what it is. Because conversion yields necessarily determined results for E and I statements, it can be used as the basis for immediate inferences having these types of statements as premises. The following inference forms are valid:</p>

                                  To make the first rule of obversion, change the quality without changing its quantity. The affirmative quantifier “all “has to be replaced by the negative quantifier “no.” This is to change the affirmative quality of the proposition into negative quality. And again the quantity of these propositions are universal, that is the propositions that begins by “All S are and “No S are” are both universal in quantity.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">3. The affirmative proposition “some S are “should be replaced as “some S are not” for the purpose of changing its quality. Besides, the predicate should be replaced by its opposite term, which has different meaning than a given term, symbolically represented as “non-P”.</p>
                                <p class="text-gray-600">According to the rule of obversion, all the four propositions would give us the same truth value as it is in the given proposition. This is to mean that if the given proposition is true, like for example, all S are P is true, then the new obverted statement, No S are non-P, is also be true. If the given proposition is false, the new obverted statement will be false too. It is the same for all propositions. Example: I = Some student are clever. (True). Some students are not lazy. (True) by obversion. E= No leaders are liars (False. All leaders are honest. (False)</p>

For example, if the statement “All goats are animals” is contraposed, the resulting statement is “All non-animals are non-goats.” This new statement is called the contrapositive of the given statement. To see how all four types of categorical propositions relate to their contrapositive, compare the following sets of diagrams:</p>

                                   A proposition that relates two classes, or categories, is called a categorical proposition. The classes in question are denoted respectively by the subject term and the predicate term, and the proposition asserts that either all or part of the class denoted by the subject term is included in or excluded from the class denoted by the predicate term. To put the same ideas in different words, a categorical proposition is a statement that relates two sets, classes, groups or categories which are presented in their subject or predicate positions that could be connected based on inclusion (partial/whole) or exclusion (partial/whole) relations. In this chapter, you have, also, learnt the different components of categorical proposition, the difference between modern and traditional square of opposition and how to evaluate arguments/inferences using different propositional representation.
