        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Human beings ask questions about nature of morality. In the process of prescriptive inquiry, we employ a specific vocabulary. We also invoke theories to explain the nature of morality. All moral theories address the questions of what is Good, why it's Good, and where the Good is located?
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          If there is anything "easy” about moral inquiry it's the fact that there are only three basic kinds of prescriptive moral theories: teleological theories, deontological theories, and virtue-based theories. Unfortunately, they often (but not always) provide different and mostly conflicting answers to these basic questions. This Chapter aim to introduce you to various ethical theories.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">2.3 Normative Ethics</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           We may now begin our review of problems and views in the area of normative ethics, starting with the theory of obligation and then going on to the theory of moral value and, finally, to the theory of nonmoral value. The ultimate concern of the normative theory of obligation is to guide us in the making of decisions and judgments about actions in particular situations. A main concern is to guide us as agents deciding what we should do.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           But we also wish to make judgments about what others should do, what should have been done, or whether an action was right or wrong. We are agents, spectators, advisers, instructors, judges, and critics. In all these roles, our primary question is: how may or should we decide or determine what is morally right for a certain agent (oneself or another) to do, or what he morally ought to do, in a certain situation?
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2">Normative ethics:</p>
         <ul class="list-[circle] pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 mb-4">
             <li>Offers theories or accounts of the best way to live. These theories evaluate actions in a systematic way, focusing on outcomes, duties, or motivation to justify human conduct.</li>
             <li>Includes ethical theories like utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics, principlism, narrative ethics, and feminist ethics.</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2">Normative ethics poses questions like:</p>
         <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1">
             <li>Are there general principles or rules to distinguish right and wrong?</li>
             <li>Are there virtues and/or relationships we can nurture to behave well?</li>
         </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Slide 4: Teleological Ethics (Consequentialist) Intro -->
      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">2.3.1 Teleological Ethics (Consequentialist)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2">What is teleological/Consequentialist ethics?</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          It is referred as “the end justifies the means”. It believes in purpose, ends or goals of an action. It stresses that the <strong>consequences</strong> of an action determine the morality or immorality of a given action. An action is judged as right or wrong, moral or immoral depending on what happens because of it. One may have the best intention or follow high moral principles, but if the result is harmful or bad, the act is judged morally or ethically wrong.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Moral philosophers offer alternative standards to prevailing moral rules. These generally fall into two sorts: (1) <strong>deontological theories</strong> and (2) <strong>teleological ones</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          A <strong>teleological theory</strong> says the basic or ultimate criterion of what is morally right, wrong, obligatory, etc., is the <strong>non-moral value</strong> brought into being. The final appeal must be to the comparative amount of good produced, or the comparative balance of good over evil.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 mb-4">
            <li>An act is <strong>right</strong> if and only if it or its rule produces (or probably will/is intended to) at least as great a balance of good over evil as any alternative.</li>
             <li>An act is <strong>wrong</strong> if and only if it does not.</li>
             <li>An act <strong>ought to be done</strong> if and only if it or its rule produces (or probably will/is intended to) a greater balance of good over evil than any alternative.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Slide 5: Teleological Ethics Continued -->
      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">2.3.1 Teleological Ethics (Continued)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           For a teleologist, the moral quality/value of actions, persons, or traits depends on the comparative nonmoral value they bring about (or try to). Making moral quality depend on the moral value it promotes would be circular. Teleological theories make the right, obligatory, and morally good dependent on the <strong>nonmorally good</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           To know if something is right, ought to be done, or is morally good, one must first know what is good in the nonmoral sense and whether the thing in question promotes it.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Teleologists may hold various views on what is nonmorally good.
           <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-1">
               <li><strong>Hedonists:</strong> Identify good with pleasure and evil with pain. The right action/rule produces the greatest balance of pleasure over pain.</li>
               <li><strong>Non-hedonists:</strong> Identify good with power, knowledge, self-realization, perfection, etc.</li>
           </ul>
           The key is that the teleologist has *some* view of good/bad and determines right/obligatory by what is conducive to the greatest balance of good over evil.
         </p>
      </div>

       <!-- Slide 6: Deontological vs Teleological & Forms of Teleology -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Deontological vs. Teleological Ethics</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           <strong>Deontological theories</strong> deny what teleological theories affirm. They deny that right, obligatory, and morally good are wholly a function of nonmoral good or maximizing the balance of good over evil (for self, society, or world). They assert other considerations make an action/rule right or obligatory besides consequences – e.g., features of the act itself (keeping a promise, justice, divine command).
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Teleologists believe the sole ultimate right-making characteristic is the comparative nonmoral value produced. Deontologists deny this, insisting there are other basic right-making characteristics. For them, maximizing good over evil is either not a moral standard or not the *only* basic one.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           A deontologist contends an action/rule can be morally right/obligatory even if it doesn't promote the greatest balance of good over evil. It might be right due to some other fact or its own nature.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2">Forms of Teleological Ethics (differ by 'whose good'):</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>Ethical Egoism:</strong> Promote one's own greatest good (Epicurus, Hobbes, Nietzsche). An act/rule is right iff it promotes at least as great a balance of good over evil for *oneself* in the long run as any alternative.</li>
              <li><strong>Ethical Universalism (Utilitarianism):</strong> Promote the greatest general good (Bentham, Mill). An act/rule is right iff it is conducive to at least as great a balance of good over evil in the *universe as a whole* as any alternative.</li>
              <li><strong>Intermediate theories:</strong> Promote good for a specific group (nation, class, family, race).</li>
              <li><strong>Ethical Altruism:</strong> Promote the good of *other* people.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">We will focus on egoism and universalism (utilitarianism).</p>

      <!-- Slide 7: Egoism Introduction -->
      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">2.3.2 Egoism: Ethical and Psychological</h2>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">2.3.2.1 Ethical Egoism</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           We usually assume morality involves not being overly concerned with oneself; selfishness is seen as unacceptable. However, disagreement exists about what constitutes ethical behavior.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Since early Western history, the viewpoint that humans are *not* built to look out for others' interests has surfaced. Some argue proper moral conduct is "looking out for number one." These are known as psychological egoism and ethical egoism.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Focusing on consequences (ends justify means) doesn't necessarily imply egoist consequences (maximizing one's own happiness). For example, Machiavelli argued for using any means (force, deceit) to maintain political power for oneself/party. This is Consequentialist but not utilitarian (lacks common good as ultimate end).

        <div class="activity-box">
            <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700">Dear Students, would you give your view on the following case?</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">
               Some years ago, a Good Samaritan stopped to help a man whose car had broken down. The man shot and killed the Samaritan, stole his car, and led police on a high-speed chase until killed. Most admire the Samaritan, but the ethical egoist would say the Samaritan did the wrong thing. For ethical egoism, the only rule is: <strong>Look after yourself</strong>. Stopping was throwing his life away.
            </p>

       <!-- Slide 8: Ethical Egoism Explained -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">2.3.2.1 Ethical Egoism (Continued)</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           This theory is called <strong>ethical egoism</strong> because it's a normative theory about how we *ought* to behave. It implies we ought to be selfish, or self-interested. "Ethical" here just means it's a theory advocating egoism as a moral rule.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2">"You should look after yourself"</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           The ethical egoist insists not taking advantage is foolish. Morality results from self-interest: if I mistreat others, they mistreat me, so I behave myself. This is a twisted version of the Golden Rule ("Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"), slanted towards self-interest. We treat others well *so that* we might receive similar treatment – we do it for ourselves.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2">Argument from Psychological Egoism:</p>
         <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1">
            <li>We all always seek to maximize our own self-interest (definition of psychological egoism).</li>
            <li>If one cannot do an act, one has no obligation to do that act (ought implies can).</li>
            <li>Altruistic acts involve putting others' interests ahead of our own (definition of altruism).</li>
            <li>But, altruism contradicts psychological egoism and so is impossible (by premises 1 and 3).</li>
            <li>Therefore, altruistic acts are never morally obligatory (by premises 2 and 4).</li>
         </ol>

       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Ethical Egoism Clarifications & Application</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           An ethical egoist might help a stranded motorist, not for the motorist's sake, but to ensure "what goes around, comes around." The Golden Rule emphasizes others; ethical egoism emphasizes the self. Any theory looking solely at consequences is Consequentialist.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Ethical egoism advises doing what provides long-term benefit to oneself (exercise, healthy eating, etc.). Others' interests are unimportant unless helping them advances one's own interests (helping your children because you love *them*, but not the neighbor's children unless you gain gratification).
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           This leads to a rewritten Golden Rule: It's okay to treat others advantageously to yourself (and not them) if you can get away with it.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2">Method to Apply Ethical Egoism:</p>
         <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 mb-4">
            <li>List the possible acts.</li>
            <li>For each act, see how much net good it would do *for you*.</li>
            <li>Identify the act that does the most net good *for you*.</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2">Important points about ethical egoism:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1">
              <li>Says *only* one's own welfare counts morally.</li>
              <li>Doesn't forbid helping or require harming others, but the reason must stem from how it helps *you*.</li>
              <li>Doesn't say always do what's most pleasurable; self-interest might require pain/sacrifice.</li>
          </ul>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 10: Psychological Egoism -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">2.3.2.2 Psychological Egoism</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           The main basis for ethical egoism is often psychological: an argument from human nature. It's claimed we are constituted to always seek our own advantage/welfare, or what we *think* gives the greatest balance of good over evil. Butler called this "self-love" as the only basic principle. Contemporary terms include "ego-satisfaction" as the final aim or the "pleasure principle" as the basic drive.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            If this psychological claim is true, the argument goes, our moral theory must recognize it. Our basic ethical principle must be self-love (perhaps "cool" self-love). Anything else flies in the face of facts.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            One might object that we can't logically infer an ethical conclusion (ought) from a psychological premise (is). However, the egoist might argue: if human nature *is* purely self-interested, it's unrealistic and unreasonable to propose we *ought* to do anything else. Since "ought" implies "can," and we supposedly *can* only act self-interestedly (except by mistake), ethical egoism is the only reasonable approach.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Thus, ethical egoism generally presupposes <strong>psychological egoism</strong>: that each of us *is* always seeking our own greatest good (pleasure, happiness, power, etc.). The question isn't whether egoism is strong, but whether we *ever* desire others' welfare for its own sake, not just as a means to our own welfare.
          </p>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 11: Arguments Against Psychological Egoism -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Arguments Against Psychological Egoism</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Counterarguments (often attributed to Bishop Butler) against psychological egoism:</p>
         <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li>The desire for one's own good presupposes more basic desires (food, fame, sex). Without these "primary appetites," there'd be no "good" to be concerned about. Our welfare *is* the satisfaction of such desires.</li>
            <li>It follows that the object of basic desires isn't one's own welfare, but the specific things (food, fame). One's own good (self-love) is just *one* desire among many, not the object of *all* desires.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the object of a basic desire is for oneself (e.g., food). But it could be for someone else (e.g., enjoying the sight of the ocean, wanting someone else to enjoy something). Altruistic impulses (and desiring the right) might exist empirically.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, such altruistic interests *do* exist (as does malevolence – desiring another's pain for its own sake), and a desire to do the right.</li>
         </ol>
         <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2">The Psychological Egoist's Rebuttal and Counter-Rebuttal:</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            The egoist might say: "Yes, we do things for others, but we get *satisfaction* from it, and that satisfaction is our real end. Doing the 'altruistic' thing is just a means to our own satisfaction/good."
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             The counter: Of course we get satisfaction, but we don't do the act *because* of the expected satisfaction; we get satisfaction *because* we wanted to do the act in the first place. The egoist confuses the *object* of the desire (e.g., Person A enjoying the ocean) with the *satisfaction* that results for Person B when the object is attained. If B fails to get A to the ocean, B feels frustration *because* his goal was for A to enjoy himself, not because B's goal was frustration.
           </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">Generally, Egoistic and particularistic consequentialism consider only effects on oneself or a limited group (family, citizens, race). Moral rightness depends on consequences for the individual agent or group.</p>

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            A more promising strategy uses definite moral rules/principles.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            If you decided to give the money to the Ethiopian Coffee Club to keep your promise (following the principle "Always keep your promise"), you adhered to <strong>deontology</strong>. Deontological systems value the act/kind of act itself; certain features have intrinsic value (e.g., lying is intrinsically wrong).
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            If you decided to give the money to ERCS to save lives and restore solvency, you sided with <strong>teleological ethics (consequentialism)</strong>. The center of value is the outcome/consequences. Lying might be judged right/wrong based on the consequences it produces.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            We examined one teleological ethic: ethical egoism (right act produces most good for the agent).

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Unlike egoism, <strong>utilitarianism</strong> is a *universal* teleological system. It calls for maximizing goodness in *society* – the greatest goodness for the greatest number – not just the agent's good.

       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">2.3.3.1 Classic Utilitarianism</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           We use utilitarian reasoning often. Formally, seeds were sown by Epicurus (342–270 BCE): "pleasure is the goal... the standard by which we judge everything good." Rightness/wrongness depends on pleasure/pain produced. Epicurus focused on individual experience (a form of egoism).
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Epicurus inspired 18th-century philosophers emphasizing *general* happiness – pleasing consequences impacting others.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             The classical expressions are from English philosophers/reformers <strong>Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832)</strong> and <strong>John Stuart Mill (1806–1873)</strong>. They were nonreligious, optimistic humanists focused on moral and legal reform, impatient with rule-bound systems, seeking to make law serve human needs and interests.
           </p>
         <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">2.3.3.2 Jeremy Bentham: Quantity over Quality</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Bentham articulated two main features of utilitarianism:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>The consequentialist principle (teleological aspect):</strong> Rightness/wrongness is determined by the goodness/badness of results. The end justifies the means.</li>
              <li><strong>The utility principle (hedonic aspect):</strong> The only thing good in itself is some state like pleasure, happiness, or welfare.</li>
          </ul>
       </div>

      <!-- Slide 15: Hedonistic Utilitarianism & Hedonic Calculus -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Hedonistic Utilitarianism & Hedonic Calculus</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            <strong>Hedonistic utilitarianism</strong> views pleasure as the sole good, pain as the sole evil. An act is right if it brings more pleasure than pain or prevents pain; wrong if it brings more pain than pleasure or prevents pleasure.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Bentham invented the <strong>hedonic calculus</strong> for measuring pleasure/pain. The quantitative score for any experience sums seven aspects:
           <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>Intensity</li>
                <li>Duration</li>
                <li>Certainty</li>
                <li>Nearness (propinquity)</li>
                <li>Fruitfulness (fecundity - tendency to lead to more pleasures)</li>
                <li>Purity (tendency not to be followed by pains)</li>
                <li>Extent (number of people affected)</li>
           </ol>
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           By adding up pleasure/pain scores for all possible acts and comparing, we decide which to perform. In our example, if giving to famine victims causes 3 million "hedons" (happiness units) and giving to the club causes < 1,000 hedons, we *must* give to the victims.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Appeal of Bentham's utilitarianism:
           <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
               <li>Simple (one principle: maximize pleasure, minimize suffering).</li>
               <li>Commonsensical (morality seems about reducing suffering, promoting benevolence).</li>
               <li>Scientific (quantitative measurement, impartial application - no special treatment for self/others based on race, gender, relationship, religion).</li>
           </ul>
         </p>
       </div>

      <!-- Slide 16: John Stuart Mill: Quality over Quantity -->
      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">2.3.3.3 John Stuart Mill: Quality over Quantity</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            To counter objections that utilitarianism was a "pig philosophy" (valuing only base pleasures), Bentham's successor, J.S. Mill, distinguished happiness from mere sensual pleasure. His version is often called <strong>eudaimonistic utilitarianism</strong> (from Greek *eudaimonia*, "happiness").
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Mill defined happiness via higher-order pleasures/satisfactions: intellectual, aesthetic, social enjoyments, and minimal suffering.
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-1">
                <li><strong>Lower (elementary) pleasures:</strong> Eating, drinking, sexuality, resting, sensuous titillation. More intensely gratifying, but can lead to pain if overindulged.</li>
                <li><strong>Higher pleasures:</strong> High culture, science, intellectuality, creativity. More long-term, continuous, gradual.</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 italic">
             Mill argued higher pleasures are superior: “It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied." Humans require more for true happiness: lower pleasures plus deep friendship, intellect, culture, art, knowledge, wisdom.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             The quality of higher pleasures is better. Happiness is "not a life of rapture; but moments of such, in an existence made up of few and transitory pains, many and various pleasures, with a decided predominance of the active over the passive, and having as the foundation... not to expect more from life than it is capable of bestowing."
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Mill emphasizes higher qualities (knowledge, intelligence, freedom, friendship, love, health), perhaps moving beyond pure pleasure to a non-hedonic cultivated state of mind.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Two classical types:</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           <strong>Act-utilitarianism (e.g., Bentham):</strong> Ideally, apply the principle of utility to *all* alternatives in *each* moment.
           <br><em>Definition:</em> An act is right if and only if it results in as much good as any available alternative.
           <br><em>Problems:</em>
             <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-1 mt-1">
                 <li>Practicality: Cannot do the calculations for every act; need rules of thumb (e.g., "Don't lie," "Keep promises"). But the *right* act is still the one maximizing utility.</li>
                 <li>Intuition: Seems to violate fundamental intuitions about correct behavior (e.g., could justify punishing the innocent if it maximized utility).</li>
             </ul>
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            <strong>Rule-utilitarianism (elements in Mill):</strong> Focuses on rules.
             <br><em>Definition:</em> An act is right if and only if it is required by a rule that is itself a member of a set of rules whose acceptance would lead to greater utility for society than any available alternative.
            <br><em>Rationale:</em> Humans are rule-followers. We need action-guiding rules. Act-utilitarian rule ("maximize utility") is too general. We often lack time to calculate consequences (e.g., lying vs. truth-telling), so need specific rules (like truthfulness) that pass the utility test.

      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">The Strengths of Utilitarianism</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Three positive features:</p>
         <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
             <li>
                <strong>Single principle, absolute system:</strong> "Do what will promote the most utility!" Offers a potential answer for every situation. Simple, action-guiding principle (though application can be hard).
             </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Gets to the substance of morality:</strong> Not just formal guidelines, but a material core: promote human (and animal?) flourishing, reduce suffering. Appeals to sense that morality is *for* people, about helping and alleviating suffering. Seems commonsensical (e.g., helping Kitty Genovese, giving millionaire's money to starving vs. football club).
             </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Addresses the problem of posterity:</strong> Why preserve resources for future generations? Egoism struggles here. Utilitarianism's duty is to maximize *general* happiness. If future life quality is positive, we have an obligation to continue human existence and ensure high quality of life. This implies obligations to future people: simplify lifestyles, conserve resources, protect species, reduce emissions, preserve wilderness.

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            The formulation "The greatest happiness for the greatest number" has two variables ("happiness," "number"), leading to conflict.
         </p>
          <div class="activity-box">

         </div>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            This mirrors the utilitarian problem:
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>Maximize the *number* getting happiness (spread it widely)? Might lead to procreating large populations.</li>
                <li>Maximize the *total amount* of happiness? Might allow some to be much happier if their increase offsets losers' diminished happiness.</li>
            </ul>
             Should we prioritize total happiness or highest average happiness?

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">

         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">The Consistency Objection to Rule-Utilitarianism</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Does rule-utilitarianism collapse into act-utilitarianism or become deontological? Argument: If following rules yields 100 hedons, but breaking a rule in a specific case (e.g., lying to spare feelings) yields 102 hedons without decreasing the total, shouldn't we break the rule? We could always improve rule-utilitarianism by breaking rules when utility increases, effectively making it act-utilitarianism. Thus, it may be inconsistent or lack an independent standard.
          </p>
         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">The No-Rest Objection</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            We must always do the act promoting the *most* utility. There's always something better we could be doing (helping homeless instead of cinema, saving ozone instead of sleeping). Should give away all assets beyond bare minimum. Utilitarianism seems to allow little rest or enjoyment if sacrificing increases others' happiness.
          </p>
          <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">The Publicity Objection</p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Moral principles should be public knowledge for all to obey. But utilitarians might hesitate to recommend everyone act as a utilitarian (esp. act-utilitarian) due to complex deliberation needed. Might be better if most acted as deontologists. Seems to contradict publicity requirement.

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Rule-utilitarianism might seem relativistic, endorsing different rules in different societies (e.g., polygamy vs. monogamy; "Don't waste water" in desert vs. plentiful areas). But this isn't conventional relativism; the rule isn't valid by community choice, but by the *actual situation* and utility.
         </p>
          <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Criticism of the Ends Justifying Immoral Means</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Chief criticism: Utilitarian ends could justify immoral means (deceit, torture, slavery, killing minorities) if the larger populace benefits.
            <br><em>Argument:</em>
             <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>If a moral theory justifies universally deemed impermissible actions, it must be rejected.</li>
                <li>Utilitarianism justifies such actions.</li>

             </ol>
          </p>
           <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">The Lying Objection</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
               W.D. Ross: Utilitarianism counterintuitively endorses lying if it serves the greater good. If Act A (lie) and Act B (truth) both yield 100 hedons, utilitarianism sees them as equal value. Implausible; truth seems intrinsically good.
            </p>
             <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Utilitarian reply: Truthfulness likely promotes overall welfare (needed for reliable info) and would be a rule-utility. But where lying *clearly* promotes utility without undermining the rule (e.g., lying to a gangster, white lies), we should lie.
             </p>

        <!-- Slide 22: Criticisms of Utilitarianism - Justice -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Criticism of Utilitarianism (4): The Justice Objection</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Utilitarian response on truth/integrity is intensified when considering justice, which most think shouldn't be compromised.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            <strong>Example 1 (Sheriff):</strong> Rape/murder in racially volatile town. To prevent deadly riot and preserve harmony, sheriff could frame an innocent tramp. Speedy trial/execution likely stops riot. Only sheriff (and real criminal) know truth. Utilitarian seems committed to framing the tramp; many find this appalling.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            <strong>Example 2 (Physician):</strong> Utilitarian physician has 5 patients needing organs (heart, lungs, liver, kidneys). Healthy bachelor comes for immunization. Utility-calculus suggests killing bachelor and using organs saves 5 lives, maximizing good.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            These careless views of justice (misusing legal/medical systems) seem frightening.
           </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             However, utilitarians can't exclude sacrificing innocents for greater good. Would we sacrifice one innocent to prevent enormous evil (e.g., nuclear bomb destroying NYC)? If only way is torturing maniac's 10-year-old daughter, would we?
           </p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Rule-utilitarian response to torture example: Two rules conflict (prevent harm vs. against torture). Appeal to higher-level rule: "Sacrifice innocent person to prevent significantly greater social harm." Or, if no rule, use remainder rule: "Do act maximizing utility." This could justify torture.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Thus, justice is just another (lower-order) principle within utilitarianism. The difficulty lies in determining *which* wide-scale disasters warrant sacrificing innocents (e.g., wartime bombings overriding noncombatant distinction; deaths from driving automobiles). These judgment calls highlight utilitarianism's difficulty with justice.
          </p>
         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Three-Step Action Formula:</p>
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 mb-4">

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">

            Deontology is referred as “the means justifies the end”. Coined as “deontics”. Rightness/wrongness determined partly by formal rules of conduct, *not* consequences. Emphasis on intentions, motives, moral principles, performance of duty, rather than results. Consequences have nothing to do with rightness/wrongness.

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             View that ethical principles are simply God's commands. Validity derives from God commanding them; they *mean* "commanded by God." Without God, no universally valid morality.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-1">Three Theses of Strong DCT:</p>
         <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 mb-4">
             <li>Morality (rightness/wrongness) originates with God.</li>
             <li>Moral rightness = "willed by God"; moral wrongness = "against God's will."</li>
             <li>Morality based on divine will, not independent reasons; no further reasons needed.</li>
         </ol>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Modified DCTs drop/qualify theses. Strong form implies: Act A is forbidden/required iff God commands not-A/A. Act A is permitted iff God commands neither A nor not-A.

         <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Redundancy of "God is good":</strong> If "good" = "what God commands," then "God is good" means "God does what God wills" or "God practices what he preaches." It doesn't ascribe a property *to* God. "God commands us to do good" becomes the empty "God commands us to do what God commands us to do."</li>
             <li><strong>Arbitrariness of morality:</strong> If God's decree is the sole arbiter, heinous acts (rape, innocent killing, cruelty) could logically become morally good if God suddenly commanded them. Morality seems arbitrary.</li>

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             A second duty-based approach. A "right" is a justified claim against another's behavior (e.g., my right not to be harmed by you).
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             <strong>Correlativity of rights and duties:</strong> Rights of one imply duties of another (e.g., If I have right to $10 payment from Smith, Smith has duty to pay me $10).

           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">2.3.4.3 Kant's Categorical Imperative</h3>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             German philosopher <strong>Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)</strong> is identified with deontology. Adamantly opposed to outcomes determining moral worth.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             For deontologists, it's the <strong>intention</strong> of the person, not consequences, that determines rightness/wrongness. Emphasis on correctness of action, regardless of benefits/harm. Some moral obligations are absolutely binding, regardless of consequences.
         </p>
          <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">The Categorical Imperative</p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Kant's duty-based theory emphasizes a single principle. He agreed we have duties (develop talents, keep promises). But argued for a more foundational principle encompassing particular duties: a single, self-evident principle of reason called the "categorical imperative."
           </p>
       </div>

      <!-- Slide 29: Categorical vs Hypothetical Imperatives -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Categorical vs. Hypothetical Imperatives</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            A <strong>categorical imperative</strong> is fundamentally different from <strong>hypothetical imperatives</strong> that hinge on personal desire (e.g., "If you want a good job, then go to college"). A categorical imperative mandates action irrespective of desires (e.g., "You ought to do X").
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Kant emphasized <strong>good intention</strong> (good will). Nothing is good in itself except a "good will." Intelligence, judgment, etc., are good only if the will using them is good.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           By <strong>will</strong>, Kant means the uniquely human capacity to act according to concepts behind laws (principles). A good will acts according to nature's laws. A will is good without qualification only if its principle is: can the maxim of its action become a universal law?
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            This standard is crucial. Kant believed there was one categorical imperative (universal command) from which all duties derive: <strong>Act in such a way that the maxim or general rule governing our action could be a universal law.</strong>
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Example: Making a promise you intend to break. Maxim: "Break promises when convenient." Could this be universal? No. It involves a contradiction of wills: you will to make promises (relying on the institution) and simultaneously will to break them (undermining the institution). Universal promise-breaking would dissolve the institution. Kant appeals to <strong>logical consistency</strong>, not bad consequences (unlike utilitarianism).
           </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">Kant gives three versions/formulations of the categorical imperative. It's a deontological theory: based on objective ethical rules. Relies on idea all people are capable of reasoning similarly.</p>

       <!-- Slide 30: Kantianism & Autonomy -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Kantianism & Autonomy</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Kantianism focuses on intent and action itself, not consequences like utilitarianism.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            <strong>Hypothetical imperatives</strong> tell us means to achieve ends, but not which ends to choose. Dichotomy: "right" ends (helping someone) vs. "good" ends (enriching oneself). Kant considered "right" superior; "good" was morally irrelevant.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Right/moral conduct cannot be decided empirically. Judgments must be *a priori* (using pure practical reason). Reason, separate from experience, determines the moral principle: the <strong>categorical imperative</strong>. It dictates what *ought* to be done without reference to empirical factors. Moral questions determined independently of the subject. Because determined by pure reason, morality is universally valid (<strong>moral universalism</strong>) – impacting concepts of human rights and equality.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Kant's theory hinges on <strong>autonomy</strong> and the categorical imperative. Unless an action is chosen freely/willingly, it has no meaning (or moral value).
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-1">
                <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> Allows self-creation of values/morality. One's own beliefs, independence, government; acting without regard for others.</li>
                <li><strong>Heteronomy:</strong> Acting under others' influence; allows placing blame externally.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
             Kant believed individuals are rational, capable of free choice (autonomous thinking). All humans, using reason on moral dilemmas, would agree on the Categorical Imperative (CI). The law is objective, but all can understand/agree via autonomous reflection. How does CI work?
           </p>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 31: Kant's Decision Procedure & Intent -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Kant's Decision Procedure & Intent</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            The decision procedure is straightforward: When considering a moral action, ask:
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1">
               <li>What would happen if everyone did this, all the time?</li>
               <li>Would that be the kind of world I'd like to live in?</li>
            </ol>
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Example: Murder. If everyone started killing, chaos ensues. Not a desirable world. Therefore, murder is wrong.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             A core aspect is <strong>intent</strong>. Intentions matter to Kant.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Example: Murderer sees defenseless man, has knife. Considers killing. Decides not to kill – *not* because it's immoral, but due to risk of getting caught (self-preservation).
             <br>Kant: You haven't acted ethically. Your action (or non-action) doesn't make you better. You didn't make a *moral* choice.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             However, if you chose not to kill because you realized it was *wrong* and didn't want to act unethically, *then* you acted morally and became a better person.
           </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
              Kant: A true moral proposition must be untied to particular conditions/identity of the deliberator. A moral maxim implies *absolute necessity*, disconnected from physical details, applicable to any rational being. Leads to first formulation...

         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">A. The Principle of Universality</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 italic">
            "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law without contradiction."
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Choose 'codes of conduct' only if they serve perfect/imperfect duty and are good for all. Kant divides duties from this formulation into two subsets:
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-1">
                <li>
                   <strong>Perfect duties:</strong> Blameworthy if not met. Basic requirements for humans. We have a perfect duty *not* to act by maxims resulting in logical contradictions when universalized.
                   <br>Example: "It is permissible to steal." Universalized, notion of property disappears, so stealing becomes impossible. Maxim logically negates itself.
                   <br>Example: Avoidance of suicide. Suicide ends life; self-love impels improving life. Contradiction.
                </li>
                <li>
                   <strong>Imperfect duties:</strong> Receive praise if completed, no blame if not. Circumstantial (e.g., cultivating talent). Based on pure reason but allow desires in practice. Not as strong as perfect duties, but still morally binding. Never truly completed. Differentiates from perfect duties because you can't constantly perform them.
                   <br>Example: Perfecting writing ability.
                </li>

       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">CI Formulation 2: Humanity as End</h2>
         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">B. The Principle of Humanity as an End, Never as Merely a Means</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 italic">
            "Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end."
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Every rational action has a principle and an end. Most ends are subjective (pursued based on hypothetical imperatives). An objective end must be pursued categorically.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             This principle has widespread approval. People, as rational beings, are ends in themselves, never to be used *merely* as means. Physical things can be means; using people merely as means (slavery, prostitution, exploitation) degrades them.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Also regulates actions affecting oneself. Suicide is wrong; treats my life as means to alleviate misery. Free will is source of rational action; treating it as subjective end denies freedom. Kant derives this second formulation from first.
           </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Combining formulations: We have *perfect duty* not to use humanity (self/others) *merely* as means. Example: Slavery. Slave owner has right to property, but not to own a person. Owning contradicts autonomy/free will, violating first maxim.
            </p>
             <p class="text-gray-600">
               Always treat people with dignity, never as mere instruments. Treating as end = reflecting their inherent value (e.g., donating to charity). Treating as means = using as tool for something else (e.g., stealing neighbor's car for my happiness - wrong).

         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">C. The Principle of Autonomy</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 italic">
             "Therefore, every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim always a legislating member in the universal kingdom of ends."
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             A truly autonomous will isn't subject to external interests, only laws it makes for itself. But these laws must be universalizable (as if binding others). Kant presents hypothetical "Kingdom of Ends" where all consider themselves both means and ends. Our actions affect everyone; should benefit all universally.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Recap Formulation 2: "Act... treat humanity... always... as an end and never merely as a means." We have perfect duty not to act by maxims creating incoherent states when universalized; imperfect duty not to act by maxims leading to unstable/undesirable states.

             Famous example: Crazed axe-murderer at door asks where your children are. Lying seems right, but universal lying is bad world. CI says you can't lie. Tell truth? Kant said yes, immoral to lie (but could lock door/call police).

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">2.3.4.4 Ross's Prima Facie Duties or Moral Guidelines</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Fourth duty-based theory: British philosopher <strong>W.D. Ross (1877–1971)</strong>, emphasizing *prima facie* duties. (*Prima facie* = "at first sight" or "on the surface").
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           <strong>Prima facie duties:</strong> Duties dictating what we should do when other moral factors aren't considered. Generally obligate us, but might not in a specific case due to circumstances.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            <strong>Actual duty:</strong> The action one *ought* to perform after considering and weighing *all* relevant prima facie duties.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Ross: Several prima facie duties help determine our concrete duty. A prima facie duty is binding (obligatory) *other things equal* (unless overridden/trumped by another duty). Strong presumption in its favor.
            <br>Example: Duty to keep promises. Ought to keep promise unless stronger moral considerations override.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Our <strong>actual or concrete duty</strong> is what we *should* perform in the specific situation. Morally bound to perform it. Prima facie duties relate to actual duties like reasons relate to conclusions.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
             Term "duty" in "prima facie duty" is slightly misleading. They are <strong>guidelines</strong>, not exceptionless rules. Not following a guideline isn't necessarily violating a rule. But failing to do one's *actual* duty *is* violating a rule (the rule corresponding to the actual duty in that case).

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Ross argues duties are "part of the fundamental nature of the universe." His list reflects actual moral convictions:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2 text-sm">
           <li><strong>Duties of Fidelity:</strong> Keep promises, don't lie/deceive.</li>
           <li><strong>Duties of Reparation:</strong> Make up for injuries done to others ("resting on a previous wrongful act"). Compensate harm caused.</li>
           <li><strong>Duties of Gratitude:</strong> Thank/help those who help us. (E.g., helping a friend who was previously selfless).</li>
           <li><strong>Duties of Justice:</strong> Act so benefits/burdens distributed fairly. Ross emphasizes negative aspect: duty to upset/prevent distributions not according to merit (pleasure/happiness). Includes preventing unjust distribution.</li>
           <li><strong>Duties of Beneficence:</strong> Improve conditions of others (foster health, security, wisdom, goodness, happiness). "Rests upon the fact that there are other beings... whose condition we can make better..."</li>
           <li><strong>Duties of Self-improvement:</strong> Act to promote one's own good (health, security, wisdom, goodness, virtue, intelligence, happiness).</li>
           <li><strong>Duties of Non-maleficence:</strong> Non-injury. Don't harm others physically/psychologically (health, security, intelligence, character, happiness). Obliged to avoid hurting others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4 text-sm">
           (Jacques Thiroux added duty to *prevent* injury by others, distinct from Ross's non-injury which is about *not causing* harm intentionally/negligently/ignorantly).

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Ancient Greek philosopher <strong>Aristotle (384-322 B.C.)</strong> detailed virtue morality in *Nicomachean Ethics*. Understood 'virtus' as strength; virtues are strengths of character. Virtue theory later overshadowed by utilitarianism/deontology.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Resurfaced in past 50 years (Philippa Foot, Alasdair MacIntyre, Elizabeth Anscombe). Disillusioned with mainstream theories, argue virtue-based theory better answers "how ought we live?" than calculating consequences or obeying rules.
        </p>
        <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Key questions in virtue ethics:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 mb-4">
           <li>What sort of person do I want to be?</li>
           <li>What virtues characterize that person?</li>
           <li>What actions cultivate those virtues?</li>
           <li>What actions characterize that sort of person?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Good, right, happiness: Good isn't a disposition, involves teleological system involving actions.
          <br> A. Good is what all things aim at. Something good performs its proper function (good cup, good oak). Right action conduces to good; different goods for different sciences/arts. "The good" (best good) desired for own sake; for humans, this is <strong>eudaimonia</strong> (activity of soul per *arete* - excellence/virtue). *Eudaemonia* = living/doing well.
          <br> B. Human good not solved with mathematical exactitude (math starts general, argues to conclusions; ethics starts specific, argues to general). Ethics starts with actual moral judgments. Aristotle assumes natural tendencies.

                <li>Moral virtue not end of life (can coexist with inactivity, misery).</li>

                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
                        <li>Happiness involves both moral and intellectual *arete*.</li>

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            A. People have natural capacity for good character, developed through practice. Capacity doesn't come first.

                 <li>*Arete* (virtue/excellence) is disposition developed from capacity by proper exercise.</li>
                 <li>Habits developed through acting; character is structure of habits, formed by what we do.</li>
           </ul>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
             B. Virtue (*arete*) defined as a <strong>mean</strong> between two extremes (excess and defect) regarding feeling/action, as practically wise person (*phronimos*) would determine. Mean not calculated *a priori*.

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 italic">
             "In metaethics, we are concerned not with questions which are the province of normative ethics like 'Should I give to famine relief?'... but with questions about questions like these."

             <li>What does "good," "right," or "justice" mean?</li>

         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            <strong>Cognitivists:</strong> Moral judgments express <strong>beliefs</strong>. Beliefs can be true/false (are truth-apt). So, moral judgments capable of being true/false.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             <strong>Non-cognitivists:</strong> Moral judgments express <strong>non-cognitive states</strong> (emotions, desires). These are not truth-apt. So, moral judgments not capable of being true/false. (Note: Desire *itself* isn't T/F, though "I have desire X" *can* be T/F).

            <strong>Strong cognitivism:</strong> Moral judgments (a) are truth-apt, AND (b) can result from cognitively accessing facts making them true. Can be naturalist or non-naturalist.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             <strong>Naturalism:</strong> Moral judgment true/false due to a *natural* state of affairs, accessed by true judgment. What is natural? G.E. Moore: Subject matter of natural sciences and psychology.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Natural property: Figures in natural science/psychology (e.g., property of conducing to GHPGN, preserving species). Natural state of affairs: Instantiation of natural property.
           </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
               Naturalist cognitivists: Moral properties identical/reducible to natural properties.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">2.4.2.1.1 Strong Cognitivism: Non-Naturalism</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            <strong>Non-naturalists:</strong> Moral properties not identical/reducible to natural properties. They are irreducible and *sui generis* (unique).
            <br>Two types:
             <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                 <li>Moore's ethical non-naturalism (*Principia Ethica*, 1903): Moral goodness is non-natural, simple, unanalysable property.</li>
                  <li>Contemporary version (McDowell, Wiggins, 1970s+).</li>
             </ul>
             Both are moral realists: Real moral facts/properties exist, independent of human opinion.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">2.4.2.1.2 Strong Cognitivism without Moral Realism: Mackie's 'Error-Theory'</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           <strong>John Mackie:</strong> Moral judgments *are* truth-apt and, if true, would grant access to moral facts. However, moral judgments are *always false*.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Why? Simply no moral facts/properties of the required sort exist.
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>No plausible epistemology for accessing such facts/properties.</li>
                <li>Such properties/facts would be "metaphysically queer" – unlike anything else. A moral property would have to motivate mere apprehension of it, which Mackie finds problematic.</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">
            Conclusion: No moral properties/facts. Positive moral judgments uniformly false. Our moral thinking involves radical error. Mackie is *not* a moral realist, but a moral *antirealist*.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            <strong>Weak cognitivism:</strong> Moral judgments (a) are truth-apt, BUT (b) *cannot* be upshot of cognitive access to moral properties/states of affairs.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Agrees with strong cognitivism on (a), disagrees on (b). Example: Theory where our *best judgments* about morals *determine* extensions of moral terms, rather than tracking/detecting independent facts. (Extension = class of things predicate applies to).
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Moral judgments T/F, but not based on tracking/accessing faculty. Rejects moral realism by denying facts are constitutively independent of human opinion (not by denying facts exist like error-theory).
         </p>

         <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6 text-gray-700">2.4.3 Non-Cognitivism</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            <strong>Non-cognitivists:</strong> Deny moral judgments even apt to be true/false. Disagree with both weak/strong cognitivism.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Argument from moral psychology (example):
             <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>Cognitivist: Moral judgments express beliefs.</li>
                <li>Motivation requires belief + desire (e.g., reach for fridge = belief water inside + desire water).</li>
                <li>Internal/necessary fact: Sincerely judging X good motivates pursuing X.</li>
                 <li>So, if moral judgment expressed belief, it'd be belief *necessarily* connected to desire.</li>
                 <li>But, Hume: Beliefs/desires distinct existences; no necessary connection possible.</li>
                 <li>Therefore, moral judgments cannot express beliefs. Therefore, not truth-apt.</li>
             </ul>

         <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2">Three versions of non-cognitivism:</p>
         <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li>J. Ayer's <strong>emotivism</strong> (1936): Moral judgments express emotions, sentiments of approval/disapproval.</li>
             <li>Simon Blackburn's <strong>quasi-realism</strong> (1984): Moral judgments express dispositions to form sentiments of approval/disapproval.</li>
             <li>Allan Gibbard's <strong>norm-expressivism</strong> (1990): Moral judgments express acceptance of norms.</li>
         </ul>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Main challenge: <strong>Frege-Geach problem</strong>.
            <br> Emotivism: Judging "murder is wrong" = shouting "Boo for murder!" (evincing disapproval, not describing).
            <br> But what about conditional statements like "If murder is wrong, then murdering your mother-in-law is wrong"? This makes sense.
            <br> On emotivist interpretation, it *doesn't* make sense. (What would "If Boo for murder!, then Boo for murdering mother-in-law!" mean?) Difficulty embedding moral statements in complex sentences.

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Some cognitivists respond by denying internalism. Connection between judgment and motivation is only external/contingent. These are <strong>externalists</strong>.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Other cognitivists deny another premise: that motivation always involves *both* belief and desire (<strong>Humean theory of motivation</strong>). McDowell/Wiggins advance <strong>anti-Humean theory</strong>: beliefs *themselves* can be intrinsically motivating.
         </p>
         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Generally, Meta-ethics:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 mb-4">
             <li>Examines meaning of moral terms/concepts and relationships.</li>
             <li>Explores origins of moral values (personhood, autonomy).</li>
             <li>Considers difference between moral and other values.</li>
             <li>Examines justification of moral claims.</li>

          <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Meta-ethics also poses questions like:</p>
           <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1">
              <li>What does "life is sacred" mean?</li>
              <li>Are moral claims personal view, religious belief, social standard, or objective?</li>
               <li>If objective, what makes them so?</li>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Chapter Summary</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Ethics is crucial for students to adopt ethical behavior for a good life, promoting a healthy society and fulfilling individual experience. In globalization, "Ethics will be one of the enablers of competitiveness." Stressing ethics' centrality benefits humankind and society, fostering growth through ethical qualities.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Morality concerns habits, customs, ways of life assessed as good/bad, right/wrong. Moral values regulate behavior, maintain society, ensure peace/stability. Individuals have moral responsibility to respect societal values and avoid disturbing stability.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            While utilitarianism, deontology, virtue theory are canonical, they evolve. Critiques lead to clarity and attunement to human living. Contemporary theories (principlism, narrative, feminist ethics) offer developments, fill gaps, acknowledge need to move from abstraction to concrete situations. This helps assess how moral theory guides decision-making and judgment.
