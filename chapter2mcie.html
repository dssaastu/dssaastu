        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Human beings naturally inquire into the nature of morality, asking questions about right and wrong, good and bad. In this prescriptive inquiry, we utilize specific ethical vocabulary and invoke various theories to explain morality's nature. Essentially, all moral theories address fundamental questions: What is the Good? Why is it Good? Where is the Good located?
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Moral inquiry involves exploring different perspectives. Generally, prescriptive moral theories fall into three basic categories: teleological (consequentialist), deontological (duty-based), and virtue-based theories. These approaches often provide distinct, sometimes conflicting, answers to core ethical questions. This chapter aims to introduce these major ethical theories.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           We begin our exploration within <strong>normative ethics</strong>, which focuses on establishing standards or norms for conduct. It addresses theories of obligation (what actions are right/wrong) and theories of value (what states of affairs are good/bad). The primary concern of normative theories of obligation is to guide decision-making and judgment regarding actions in specific situations, addressing the question: how should we decide what is morally right or obligatory for an agent (oneself or another) in a given circumstance?

      <!-- Slide 4: Teleological Ethics (Consequentialist) Intro -->
      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">2.3.1 Teleological Ethics (Consequentialism)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2">What is Teleological/Consequentialist Ethics?</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Teleological ethics, often summarized as "the end justifies the means," judges the morality of an action based solely on its <strong>consequences</strong> or outcomes (from Greek *telos*, meaning end or purpose). An action is considered right or wrong depending on the results it produces. Good intentions or adherence to rules are secondary; if the outcome is harmful, the act is judged morally wrong.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Moral theories generally fall into two main categories regarding the basis of moral judgment: (1) deontological and (2) teleological.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           A <strong>teleological theory</strong> posits that the ultimate criterion for determining what is morally right, wrong, or obligatory is the <strong>non-moral value</strong> produced by the action or rule. The final judgment rests on comparing the amount of good produced versus evil, or the balance of good over evil.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 mb-4 text-sm"> <!-- Smaller font -->
            <li>An act is <strong>right</strong> if it (or the rule it follows) produces at least as great a balance of good over evil as any available alternative.</li>
             <li>An act is <strong>wrong</strong> if it does not meet this criterion.</li>
             <li>An act <strong>ought to be done</strong> if it (or its rule) produces a greater balance of good over evil than any alternative.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Slide 5: Teleological Ethics and Non-Moral Good -->
      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Teleological Ethics and Non-Moral Good</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           For teleologists, the moral quality of actions, persons, or character traits depends entirely on the comparative *non-moral* value they bring about or intend to bring about. (Defining moral value in terms of moral value would be circular). Thus, teleological theories make rightness and moral goodness dependent on achieving the <strong>non-morally good</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           To determine if an action is right or obligatory according to a teleological theory, one must first identify what constitutes non-moral good (e.g., happiness, knowledge, pleasure) and then assess whether the action in question effectively promotes the greatest balance of that good over evil.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Teleologists differ on what constitutes the non-morally good:
           <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-1">
               <li><strong>Hedonists:</strong> Identify good solely with pleasure and evil solely with pain. The right action maximizes the balance of pleasure over pain.</li>
               <li><strong>Non-hedonists:</strong> Identify good with other values like power, knowledge, self-realization, perfection, etc.</li>
           </ul>
           Despite differing views on the specific 'good', all teleological theories determine rightness based on maximizing the net balance of that chosen non-moral good.
         </p>

       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Deontological vs. Teleological Ethics Compared</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           <strong>Deontological theories</strong> (from Greek *deon*, meaning duty) fundamentally reject the teleological premise. They deny that rightness, obligation, and moral goodness depend *solely* on maximizing non-moral good. Deontologists argue that other factors besides consequences determine moral rightness—such as features of the act itself (e.g., keeping a promise is intrinsically right), adherence to rules or duties (e.g., respecting rights, following divine commands), or motives.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           While teleologists see maximizing good consequences as the *only* ultimate right-making characteristic, deontologists believe other factors are also intrinsically right-making, or that maximizing good is either not a moral requirement or not the *sole* basic one.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
           For a deontologist, an action can be morally right or obligatory even if it doesn't produce the best overall consequences, perhaps because it fulfills a duty or respects a right.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2 mt-4">Forms of Teleological Ethics (Distinguished by Beneficiary):</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Common morality often assumes we shouldn't be excessively self-centered; selfishness is generally frowned upon. However, historical and philosophical perspectives have challenged this, suggesting that perhaps humans are primarily oriented towards their own interests. This leads to two related but distinct concepts: psychological egoism and ethical egoism.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Some consequentialist views prioritize self-interest or group interest. For example, Machiavelli advocated using any means necessary to maintain political power, a consequentialist approach focused on the ruler's or party's ends, not necessarily the common good (thus distinct from utilitarianism).

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">
               Imagine a Good Samaritan stops to help a stranded motorist, who then shoots and kills the Samaritan. Most would admire the Samaritan's action despite the tragic outcome. An ethical egoist, however, might argue the Samaritan acted wrongly. Why? Because for ethical egoism, the primary moral rule is: <strong>Look after your own self-interest</strong>. Stopping put the Samaritan's life at risk for no personal gain, violating this principle.
            </p>
            <p class="italic text-gray-600 mt-2">What is your perspective on the Samaritan's action in light of ethical egoism?</p>

       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">2.3.2.1 Ethical Egoism Explained</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           This theory is termed <strong>ethical egoism</strong> because it is a *normative* theory proposing how we *ought* to behave—namely, selfishly or in our own rational self-interest. The term "ethical" here simply indicates it's a theory *about* morality, one that advocates egoism as the correct moral stance.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2 text-center">Core Principle: "You should act always to maximize your own self-interest."</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           From this perspective, acting against one's self-interest is foolish. Cooperative or seemingly altruistic behavior is justified only if it ultimately serves one's own interests (e.g., "I treat others well *so that* they will treat me well"). This reinterprets reciprocity and rules like the Golden Rule through a lens of self-interest.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2">Argument Often Based on Psychological Egoism:</p>

            <li>Premise: All humans inherently seek to maximize their own self-interest (Psychological Egoism).</li>
            <li>Premise: One cannot be obligated to do what is impossible ("ought implies can").</li>
            <li>Premise: Altruism requires prioritizing others' interests over one's own.</li>
            <li>Inference: Altruism contradicts psychological egoism and is therefore impossible (from 1 & 3).</li>
            <li>Conclusion: Therefore, acting altruistically is never morally obligatory (from 2 & 4).</li>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Ethical Egoism: Clarifications and Application</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Ethical egoism doesn't preclude helping others, but the motivation must ultimately stem from self-benefit (e.g., feeling good, expecting future reciprocation, benefiting loved ones whose happiness contributes to one's own). It prioritizes *long-term* self-interest, which might involve actions like healthy eating or exercise that involve immediate discomfort for future gain.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           The theory fundamentally asserts that only one's own welfare is morally significant. It doesn't necessarily endorse hedonism (seeking immediate pleasure); rational self-interest might require sacrifice or pain.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2">Applying Ethical Egoism:</p>
         <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 mb-4 text-sm"> <!-- Smaller font -->
            <li>Identify possible actions.</li>
            <li>Determine the net long-term benefit *to yourself* for each action.</li>

       <!-- Slide 10: Psychological Egoism -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">2.3.2.2 Psychological Egoism</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Ethical egoism often rests on <strong>psychological egoism</strong>, which is a *descriptive* theory about human motivation, claiming that humans *are* inherently constituted to always seek their own advantage, welfare, or perceived greatest balance of good over evil (sometimes termed "self-love," "ego-satisfaction," or driven by the "pleasure principle").
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            If psychological egoism is true (i.e., if we *can only* act self-interestedly), then ethical egoism appears to be the only reasonable moral theory, as morality cannot demand the impossible ("ought implies can").
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            The core debate, therefore, often shifts to whether psychological egoism accurately describes human motivation: Do we *ever* genuinely desire others' welfare for its own sake, or is it always merely a means to our own ultimate satisfaction?
          </p>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 11: Arguments Against Psychological Egoism -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Arguments Against Psychological Egoism</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Philosophers like Bishop Butler offer counterarguments:</p>
         <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-4 text-sm"> <!-- Smaller font -->
            <li>Seeking one's own good (self-love) logically presupposes having more basic desires for specific things (food, fame, helping others). Without these primary desires, there'd be no "good" or "satisfaction" to seek.</li>
            <li>Therefore, the object of these basic desires isn't always one's own welfare; it's the specific thing desired (e.g., food itself, another person's happiness). Self-love is just *one* desire among many.</li>
            <li>The object of a desire *can* be external to oneself (e.g., desiring another's well-being). Thus, altruistic impulses are psychologically possible.</li>
            <li>Empirically, genuinely altruistic interests (and sometimes malevolent ones, or a desire to do right for its own sake) seem to exist.</li>
         </ol>
         <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2">The Satisfaction Rebuttal and Counter:</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 text-sm"> <!-- Smaller font -->
            *Egoist:* Even when helping others, the *real* goal is the satisfaction derived from helping; the act is just a means to self-satisfaction.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 text-sm"> <!-- Smaller font -->
             *Counter:* Satisfaction is the *result* of achieving a pre-existing goal (e.g., wanting the other person to benefit), not the goal itself. We feel satisfaction *because* we achieved what we desired for the other person. Confusing the object of desire with the resulting satisfaction is a key error (Butler's Stone).
           </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">If psychological egoism is false, the main argument for ethical egoism weakens significantly, though ethical egoism could still be defended on other grounds.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Analyzing the Dilemma: Deontology vs. Teleology</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Resolving the millionaire dilemma often involves appealing to more fundamental moral rules or principles.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            If you prioritized keeping your promise to the millionaire (following the principle "Always keep promises"), your reasoning aligns with <strong>deontology</strong>. Deontological theories emphasize duties, rules, and the intrinsic nature of actions, regardless of consequences. Promise-keeping is seen as intrinsically right.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            If you prioritized giving the money to ERCS to maximize well-being (saving many lives), your reasoning aligns with <strong>teleological ethics (consequentialism)</strong>. Here, the moral value lies in the outcome; the action producing the best consequences is deemed right.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
             <strong>Utilitarianism</strong>, unlike ethical egoism, is a *universal* teleological theory. It mandates maximizing the good (often defined as happiness or welfare) not just for oneself, but for *all* affected parties—the greatest good for the greatest number. In the dilemma, utilitarianism likely favors giving the money to ERCS due to the vastly greater positive consequences.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">2.3.3.1 Classic Utilitarianism: Bentham and Mill</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           While utilitarian-like reasoning appears earlier (e.g., Epicurus focusing on individual pleasure), modern utilitarianism, emphasizing *general* happiness, originates primarily with British philosophers and social reformers <strong>Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832)</strong> and <strong>John Stuart Mill (1806–1873)</strong>. They aimed to create a rational, scientific basis for morality and law, focused on human needs and interests rather than tradition or dogma.
         </p>
         <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">2.3.3.2 Jeremy Bentham: Quantity of Pleasure</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Bentham's utilitarianism has two core components:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>The Consequentialist Principle:</strong> Rightness/wrongness depends solely on the consequences (goodness/badness of results).</li>
              <li><strong>The Utility/Hedonic Principle:</strong> Pleasure (or happiness) is the only intrinsic good; pain is the only intrinsic evil.</li>
          </ul>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">Bentham advocated <strong>hedonistic utilitarianism</strong>: the right action maximizes the net balance of pleasure over pain for all affected.</p>
       </div>

      <!-- Slide 15: Hedonic Calculus -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Bentham's Hedonic Calculus</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           To make utilitarianism scientific, Bentham proposed the <strong>hedonic calculus</strong> to quantify pleasure and pain based on seven factors:
           <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1 text-sm"> <!-- Smaller font -->
                <li><strong>Intensity:</strong> How strong is the pleasure/pain?</li>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> How long does it last?</li>
                <li><strong>Certainty:</strong> How likely is it to occur?</li>
                <li><strong>Propinquity (Nearness):</strong> How soon will it occur?</li>
                <li><strong>Fecundity (Fruitfulness):</strong> Likelihood of producing further pleasures?</li>
                <li><strong>Purity:</strong> Likelihood of not being followed by opposite sensations (e.g., pain after pleasure)?</li>
                <li><strong>Extent:</strong> How many people are affected?</li>
           </ol>
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           In theory, one calculates the net utility (pleasure minus pain) for each alternative action, considering all affected individuals and all seven factors, then chooses the action with the highest score. Applying this to the millionaire dilemma: saving 100,000 lives likely yields vastly more "hedons" (units of happiness) than improving a football club.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm italic">Appeal of Bentham's approach: Simplicity (one principle), common sense alignment (focus on welfare), attempt at scientific objectivity and impartiality.</p>

      <!-- Slide 16: John Stuart Mill: Quality of Pleasure -->
      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">2.3.3.3 John Stuart Mill: Quality over Quantity</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Responding to criticisms that Bentham's view valued base pleasures equally with higher pursuits (a "pig philosophy"), <strong>J.S. Mill</strong> modified utilitarianism. His version, often called <strong>eudaimonistic utilitarianism</strong> (from *eudaimonia*, Greek for happiness or flourishing), distinguishes between higher and lower pleasures based on *quality*, not just quantity.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Mill argued that intellectual, aesthetic, and social pleasures (higher pleasures) are intrinsically superior to purely sensual ones (lower pleasures).
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-1 text-sm"> <!-- Smaller font -->
                <li><strong>Lower pleasures:</strong> Eating, drinking, sex, rest. Intense but potentially lead to pain if overindulged.</li>
                <li><strong>Higher pleasures:</strong> Intellect, creativity, art, friendship, moral sentiment. More durable, less likely to lead to pain.</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 italic">
             Mill famously stated: “It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied." Those who have experienced both types of pleasure recognize the superior quality of the higher ones.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
             For Mill, true happiness involves cultivating these higher faculties and experiencing a life rich in varied pleasures with minimal pain, founded on realistic expectations. His focus on qualities like knowledge, freedom, and friendship arguably moves beyond pure hedonism.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">A key distinction within utilitarianism:</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           <strong>Act-Utilitarianism:</strong> Applies the principle of utility directly to each individual *act*. The right act is the one that produces the best consequences in that specific situation.
           <br><em>Critiques:</em> Impractical to calculate consequences for every act; seems to justify actions that violate common moral rules (like lying or breaking promises) if doing so maximizes utility in a particular case.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            <strong>Rule-Utilitarianism:</strong> Applies the principle of utility to determine the validity of *rules* of conduct. An act is right if it conforms to a valid moral rule. A rule is valid if its general acceptance would produce greater utility than alternative rules (or no rule).
            <br><em>Rationale:</em> Acknowledges need for stable rules to guide behavior, coordinate actions, and avoid constant calculation. Focuses on the utility of *having* rules like "keep promises" or "tell the truth."

             <li>
                <strong>Provides a single principle for decision-making:</strong> Offers a potentially unifying, absolute standard ("Maximize overall utility") applicable to all situations.

              <li>
                <strong>Focuses on the substance of morality:</strong> Directly addresses welfare, happiness, and suffering reduction, aligning with common intuitions that morality should promote well-being.
             </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Addresses obligations to future generations (Posterity):</strong> By aiming to maximize overall happiness across time, utilitarianism provides a basis for conserving resources and protecting the environment for future inhabitants, unlike purely egoistic theories.

         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Problem 1: Formulating the Principle</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            The slogan "greatest happiness for the greatest number" is ambiguous. Does it mean maximizing the *total* amount of happiness (which might favor a large population with moderate happiness) or the *highest average* happiness (which might favor a smaller, very happy population)? These goals can conflict. Furthermore, how exactly is happiness/utility measured and compared between individuals?
         </p>
          <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Problem 2: Calculating Consequences</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Predicting *all* the consequences of an action, especially long-term ones, seems practically impossible. Act-utilitarianism, in particular, appears to demand superhuman foresight to determine which act truly maximizes utility over time.
          </p>

         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Problem 3: Consistency of Rule-Utilitarianism</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Critics argue rule-utilitarianism either collapses into act-utilitarianism (if rules can always be broken when doing so maximizes utility) or becomes a form of deontology (if rules are upheld even when breaking them would produce better immediate consequences). Maintaining a distinct, consistent rule-utilitarian position is challenging.
          </p>
         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Problem 4: The No-Rest Objection</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Utilitarianism seems to demand constant action to maximize utility. We should always be doing whatever yields the most good, potentially leaving no room for personal projects, leisure, or rest if sacrificing these could produce more overall happiness (e.g., by constantly working for charity). It appears overly demanding.
          </p>
          <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Problem 5: The Publicity Objection</p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Moral principles arguably should be public knowledge. However, some utilitarians might worry that publicly advocating utilitarianism (especially act-utilitarianism) could lead to miscalculation or abuse, suggesting it might be better if most people followed simpler, deontological rules. This creates a potential conflict with the publicity requirement.

         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Problem 6: The Relativism Objection</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Rule-utilitarianism might appear relativistic if different rules maximize utility in different contexts (e.g., water conservation rules varying by climate). However, this isn't true relativism; the rule's validity depends on objective utility based on the *actual situation*, not just cultural acceptance.
         </p>
          <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Problem 7: Ends Justifying Immoral Means</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            A major objection is that utilitarianism could potentially justify actions widely considered immoral (e.g., lying, torture, sacrificing innocents) if doing so produces the greatest overall good.
            <br><em>Argument Structure:</em>
             <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1 text-sm"> <!-- Smaller font -->
                <li>If a moral theory justifies actions universally deemed impermissible, it's flawed.</li>
                <li>Utilitarianism potentially justifies such actions in certain circumstances.</li>
                <li>Therefore, utilitarianism is flawed.</li>
             </ol>
          </p>
           <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Example: The Lying Objection</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
               Critics like W.D. Ross argue utilitarianism wrongly implies lying is acceptable whenever it maximizes utility, conflicting with the intuition that truthfulness has intrinsic value. Utilitarians might reply that truthfulness *is* generally useful (a rule-utility) but lying is permissible in specific cases where it clearly maximizes good (e.g., white lies, lying to protect someone from harm).

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Perhaps the most serious objection concerns justice. Utilitarianism seems capable of sacrificing individual rights or fairness for the sake of maximizing overall happiness.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            <strong>Scenario 1 (Sheriff):</strong> To prevent a deadly riot, a sheriff contemplates framing an innocent person for a crime. Convicting the innocent person might maximize overall utility by restoring peace, but violates principles of justice.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            <strong>Scenario 2 (Transplant Surgeon):</strong> A surgeon realizes she could save five patients needing organs by sacrificing one healthy patient who came for a check-up. This act arguably maximizes utility (5 lives saved > 1 lost), but profoundly violates justice and individual rights.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
            These scenarios suggest utilitarianism might conflict with fundamental notions of justice and individual rights, which many believe should not be overridden merely for utility gains. While extreme cases might test intuitions (e.g., sacrificing one innocent to prevent nuclear war), the apparent willingness of utilitarianism to permit injustice for the 'greater good' remains a central criticism.

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2 mb-2">
               Does the policy 'The end justifies the means' permit morally questionable acts for good outcomes?
               <br>A. Is it common in your experience for people to justify dishonest or unjust actions by appealing to good ends?
               <br>B. Consider a doctor misleading a depressed patient about their prognosis or prescribing unnecessary medication 'just in case'. Are these justifiable?
               <br>C. Does the prevalence of such behavior suggest utilitarianism aligns well with human tendencies, or does it highlight potential dangers?
            </p>
         </div>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            In contrast to egoism, <strong>altruism</strong> holds that an action is right if its consequences are favorable for everyone *except* the person acting. It prioritizes others' welfare.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Arguments for altruism sometimes rely on <strong>psychological altruism</strong> (associated with Bishop Butler), the view that humans possess an inherent capacity for benevolence—acting out of genuine concern for others' well-being.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
             If psychological altruism exists, it counters psychological egoism. The debate centers on whether selfless motivations are genuinely possible. Consider Degu, a poor swimmer, risking his life to save a drowning child. Was his ultimate motivation self-benefit (e.g., social approval, feeling good)? Or was it genuine concern for the child, even at great personal risk? Altruism posits the latter is possible and morally commendable.

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             While consequentialist theories (like utilitarianism and egoism) determine rightness based on outcomes, <strong>deontological theories</strong> argue that morality is based on duties, rules, obligations, or rights, independent of the consequences. Certain actions are considered intrinsically right or wrong based on their nature or the principles they uphold.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Deontology emphasizes intentions, motives, moral principles, and fulfilling one's duty. The rightness or wrongness of an act lies in the act itself or the rule it follows, not primarily in the results it produces. Some moral obligations are considered absolute, regardless of the potential consequences.

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             One prominent deontological view bases morality on religion. The <strong>Divine Command Theory</strong> holds that ethical principles derive their validity solely from God's commands. An action is right because God commands it; an action is wrong because God forbids it. Without divine commands, objective morality wouldn't exist.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-1">Core Theses of Strong DCT:</p>

              Early influential accounts, like John Locke's, grounded rights in natural law ordained by God, mandating respect for life, liberty, health, and property as fundamental, natural rights.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6 text-gray-700">2.3.4.3 Kant's Categorical Imperative</h3>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             The most influential deontological theory is arguably that of <strong>Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)</strong>. Kant staunchly rejected consequentialism, arguing that the moral worth of an action lies in the *intention* or *will* behind it, specifically whether it conforms to duty derived from reason, not in the outcomes produced.
         </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
             Kant sought a supreme principle of morality, derived from pure reason, which he called the <strong>Categorical Imperative</strong>. This principle dictates moral duties absolutely and universally, independent of personal desires or consequences.
           </p>
       </div>

       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Kant: Categorical vs. Hypothetical Imperatives</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Kant distinguished the <strong>Categorical Imperative</strong> (CI) from <strong>hypothetical imperatives</strong>.
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>*Hypothetical Imperatives:* Commands conditional on desires ("*If* you want Y, *then* do X"). They guide means to achieve subjective ends.</li>
                <li>*Categorical Imperative:* An unconditional command derived from reason ("Do X" or "Don't do Y"), regardless of desires or consequences. It dictates objective moral duty.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           For Kant, the only thing good without qualification is a <strong>good will</strong>—a will that acts *from* duty, motivated by respect for the moral law derived from reason (the CI), not merely *in accordance* with duty (which could be done from self-interest or inclination).
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">
            The test for whether an action aligns with a good will is whether the principle (<strong>maxim</strong>) guiding the action can be consistently willed as a universal law, applicable to all rational beings without contradiction. This leads to the first formulation of the CI.

       <!-- Slide 31: Kant: The Role of Intent -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Kant: The Importance of Intent</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            A crucial aspect of Kant's ethics is the focus on <strong>intent</strong> or the <strong>maxim</strong> behind an action. The moral worth depends not on the outcome, but on *why* the action was performed.
         </p>
          <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Example:</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 text-sm"> <!-- Smaller font -->
             Imagine someone considers murdering another but decides against it, *not* because murder is morally wrong, but solely because they fear getting caught. According to Kant, this person has *not* acted morally. Their decision stemmed from self-preservation (a hypothetical imperative), not from respect for the moral law (the categorical imperative). The action (or non-action) lacks moral worth.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 text-sm"> <!-- Smaller font -->
             However, if the person refrains from murder *because* they recognize it as inherently wrong according to a universalizable principle, *then* their non-action has moral worth, stemming from a good will acting from duty.
           </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
              For Kant, true moral maxims must possess absolute necessity, applying universally to all rational beings, independent of specific circumstances or desires.
            </p>
       </div>

      <!-- Slide 32: CI Formulation 1: Principle of Universality -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">CI Formulation 1: The Principle of Universality</h2>
         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">A. First Formulation:</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 italic">
            "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law without contradiction."
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            This formulation provides a test: Can the principle behind your action be applied universally to everyone without generating a logical or practical contradiction? If universalizing the maxim leads to a state where the action itself becomes impossible or undermines the very system it relies upon, then the action is morally forbidden (violates a perfect duty).
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Example (False Promise): Maxim: "It is permissible to make false promises when convenient." If universalized, no one would trust promises, making the act of promising (and thus breaking promises) meaningless. The maxim contradicts itself when universalized. Therefore, making false promises violates a perfect duty.
           </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Kant also distinguishes <strong>imperfect duties</strong> (e.g., developing talents, helping others). Maxims violating these might not lead to logical contradictions when universalized, but to states of affairs that no rational being could consistently *will* (e.g., a world where no one ever helps anyone else). These duties are still binding but allow more latitude in how they are fulfilled.
           </p>

         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">B. Second Formulation:</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 italic">
            "Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means, but always at the same time as an end."
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            This formulation focuses on respecting the inherent worth and dignity of rational beings. Because humans possess reason and autonomy (the capacity for self-legislation), they are "ends in themselves," possessing intrinsic value. We must never treat people (including ourselves) *merely* as tools or instruments to achieve our own subjective ends.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Using someone as a means (e.g., hiring a plumber) is permissible if their autonomy and dignity are respected (they consent, are fairly compensated). Using them *merely* as a means (e.g., through deception, coercion, exploitation, slavery) violates their status as an end-in-themselves and is morally forbidden (violates a perfect duty). Suicide is also wrong because it treats one's own rational nature merely as a means to end suffering.
           </p>
             <p class="text-gray-600">
               Treating someone as an end involves recognizing and respecting their capacity for rational choice and their inherent value.

             "Therefore, every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim always a legislating member in the universal kingdom of ends."
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             This formulation emphasizes <strong>autonomy</strong>—the idea that rational beings are self-legislating, creating the moral law through reason. However, the maxims we legislate for ourselves must be universalizable, suitable as laws for a hypothetical "Kingdom of Ends" where everyone is treated as both a law-maker (legislator) and an end-in-themselves. Our actions should reflect principles applicable and beneficial to all rational beings.
         </p>
          <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Problem: Rigidity and Conflicting Duties</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             A major criticism of Kant's theory is its perceived rigidity. Because the CI generates absolute, exceptionless duties (perfect duties), it seems unable to handle situations where duties conflict or where following a duty leads to disastrous consequences.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Example (Murderer at the Door): If a murderer asks for the location of their intended victim (who is hiding in your house), Kant's prohibition against lying (derived from the first formulation) seems to forbid misleading the murderer, even to save a life. This counterintuitive result suggests the theory might be too inflexible for complex moral realities. Similarly, dilemmas arise where any action seems to violate a perfect duty.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Addressing the rigidity of Kantianism and the potential injustices of utilitarianism, British philosopher <strong>W.D. Ross (1877–1971)</strong> proposed a deontological theory based on multiple, non-absolute duties he called <strong>prima facie duties</strong>. (*Prima facie* means "at first sight" or "on the surface").
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           A <strong>prima facie duty</strong> is a genuine moral duty that is binding *other things being equal*. It tells us what we ought to do, assuming no other moral factors conflict. However, in situations where prima facie duties conflict, one duty might override another.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Our <strong>actual duty</strong> in a specific situation is the prima facie duty that is most stringent or weighty after considering all conflicting prima facie duties. It's what we *ultimately* ought to do in that particular circumstance.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
             Ross viewed prima facie duties as fundamental moral guidelines or considerations, intuitively recognized, rather than exceptionless rules derived from a single principle. Determining our actual duty requires careful judgment about the relative weights of conflicting prima facie duties in the specific context.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Ross believed these duties are self-evident aspects of morality, reflecting our common moral convictions. His non-exhaustive list includes:</p>
        <ul class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 text-sm"> <!-- Smaller font, numbered list -->
           <li><strong>Fidelity:</strong> Duties arising from promises and truthfulness.</li>

           <li><strong>Gratitude:</strong> Duty to return favors or services received from others.</li>
           <li><strong>Justice:</strong> Duty to distribute benefits and burdens fairly, and prevent/rectify unjust distributions.</li>
           <li><strong>Beneficence:</strong> Duty to improve the condition of others (promote their well-being).</li>
           <li><strong>Self-improvement:</strong> Duty to improve one's own condition (virtue, intelligence).</li>
           <li><strong>Non-maleficence (Non-injury):</strong> Duty not to harm others physically or psychologically. (Often considered the most stringent).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">When these duties conflict (e.g., keeping a promise vs. preventing harm), Ross argued we must use considered judgment (intuition, refined by experience) to determine which duty takes precedence and becomes our actual duty in that situation.</p>

            Ross's theory offers a more flexible deontology than Kant's, acknowledging multiple fundamental duties identified through intuition. When duties conflict, judgment determines the actual duty, which is the prima facie duty with the greatest moral weight in that context.

              Distinct from rule-based deontology and outcome-focused consequentialism, <strong>virtue ethics</strong> centers on <strong>moral character</strong>. It emphasizes cultivating virtues—positive character traits like honesty, courage, compassion, justice—as the key to ethical living.

            <p class="text-gray-600">
               Instead of asking "What is the right action?" or "What rule should I follow?", virtue ethics asks "What kind of person should I be?" The right action is often understood as what a virtuous person would characteristically do in the circumstances.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            The foundational figure in Western virtue ethics is <strong>Aristotle (384-322 BCE)</strong>, particularly in his *Nicomachean Ethics*. For Aristotle, virtues (*arete*) are excellences or strengths of character developed through habituation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Virtue ethics experienced a revival in the mid-to-late 20th century (e.g., Anscombe, Foot, MacIntyre), partly due to dissatisfaction with perceived limitations of rule-based theories in capturing the complexity of moral life.
        </p>
        <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Key questions in Aristotelian virtue ethics:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 mb-4 text-sm"> <!-- Smaller font -->
           <li>What is the ultimate human good or purpose (*telos*)? (Answer: *Eudaimonia* - flourishing, living well).</li>
           <li>What constitutes living well for a human? (Answer: Activity of the soul in accordance with virtue/excellence).</li>
           <li>What are the virtues (excellences)? (Answer: States of character, often involving finding a mean between extremes).</li>
           <li>How are virtues acquired? (Answer: Through practice and habituation).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600">Aristotle believed the ultimate human good (*eudaimonia*) is achieved through rational activity performed virtuously or excellently over a complete life, requiring both moral and intellectual virtues, plus some external goods.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Aristotle argued we have a natural capacity for virtue, but virtue itself is acquired through practice and habituation. Acting virtuously leads to developing virtuous habits, which form a virtuous character. Once character is formed, virtuous actions flow naturally from it.

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Moral virtue (*arete*) is typically a <strong>mean</strong> state between two vices: one of excess and one of deficiency, relative to us and the situation. This mean is determined by reason, specifically by the judgment of a person with <strong>phronesis</strong> (practical wisdom). It's not a strict mathematical average but finding the appropriate response between extremes.

It's acquired through experience and good judgment. Aristotle's theory is context-sensitive but not relativistic; there are objectively better/worse ways to act.</li>
           <li>While virtue is ontologically a mean (a middle state), axiologically (in terms of value) it represents an excellence or peak, superior to both extremes.</li>

            When we debate moral questions (like famine relief obligations), philosophical inquiry operates on two levels:

                <li><strong>First-Order Questions (Normative Ethics):</strong> What is the right thing to do? Which position is correct, and why?</li>
                <li><strong>Second-Order Questions (Meta-ethics):</strong> What is the *nature* of moral debate itself? What are the participants *doing* when they make moral claims? What do moral terms mean? Do moral facts exist?</li>

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            A central meta-ethical debate concerns the nature of moral judgments (e.g., "Murder is wrong"). What kind of mental state do they express?
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            <strong>Cognitivism:</strong> Moral judgments express <strong>beliefs</strong>. Since beliefs aim to represent the world and can be true or false, cognitivists hold that moral judgments are <strong>truth-apt</strong> (capable of being true or false).
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             <strong>Non-Cognitivism:</strong> Moral judgments primarily express <strong>non-cognitive states</strong>, such as emotions (approval/disapproval), desires, or commitments to norms. Since these states are not beliefs aiming to represent facts, non-cognitivists hold that moral judgments are <strong>not truth-apt</strong>.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Cognitivist theories further divide based on their view of moral facts/properties.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             <strong>Ethical Naturalism:</strong> A form of cognitivism and <strong>moral realism</strong> (the view that objective moral facts/properties exist independently of human opinion). Naturalism holds that moral properties are identical to, or reducible to, <strong>natural properties</strong>—those studied by the natural sciences or psychology (e.g., properties like maximizing happiness, promoting survival, fulfilling biological functions). Moral judgments are true/false based on these natural facts.
           </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm italic">Sub-views include naturalist reductionism (moral properties *are* other natural properties) and non-reductionist Cornell realism (moral properties are distinct *but still natural* properties).</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            <strong>Ethical Non-Naturalism:</strong> Also a form of cognitivism and moral realism, but holds that moral properties are *not* natural properties. They are real, objective properties, but they are irreducible and *sui generis* (unique), distinct from the properties investigated by science. We come to know them through means like intuition (as argued by G.E. Moore) or specific forms of rational insight.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6 text-gray-700">Mackie's Error Theory</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           <strong>Error Theory (J.L. Mackie):</strong> A cognitivist but *anti-realist* view. Mackie agreed that moral judgments *aim* to state objective facts (express beliefs and are truth-apt). However, he argued that such objective moral facts or properties *do not actually exist*.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Why? Mackie argued objective moral properties would be "metaphysically queer"—unlike anything else in the universe—and require an equally queer epistemic faculty to detect them. He also argued they would need an inherent (and mysterious) motivating power. Since such properties don't exist, *all* positive moral judgments (e.g., "X is good," "Y is wrong") are systematically *false*. Our moral thinking involves a fundamental error.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">Weak Cognitivism / Constructivism</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Some theories are cognitivist (moral judgments express truth-apt beliefs) but anti-realist. These views deny that moral truths correspond to independent, objective moral facts "out there." Instead, moral truths might be seen as *constructed* by human attitudes, conventions, or ideal procedures. For example, truth might be determined by the consensus reached under ideal conditions or by our "best opinions." Moral judgments can be true/false relative to these constructed standards, but not by tracking mind-independent moral reality.
        </p>

         <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6 text-gray-700">Non-Cognitivism Revisited</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            As stated earlier, <strong>Non-Cognitivism</strong> denies that moral judgments are truth-apt because they primarily express non-cognitive states (like emotions or commands) rather than beliefs about facts.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             A key argument for non-cognitivism relies on <strong>internalism</strong> about motivation: the idea that there's a necessary connection between sincerely making a moral judgment (e.g., "X is good") and being motivated (at least somewhat) to act accordingly. Combined with the <strong>Humean theory of motivation</strong> (motivation requires *both* a belief *and* a separate desire), non-cognitivists argue that moral judgments cannot be mere beliefs (as beliefs alone don't motivate) and must therefore express some desire-like or motivating non-cognitive state.

         <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2">Prominent Non-Cognitivist Views:</p>
         <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 mb-4 text-sm"> <!-- Smaller font -->
            <li><strong>Emotivism (A.J. Ayer, C.L. Stevenson):</strong> Moral judgments primarily express emotions or attitudes ("Murder is wrong" ≈ "Boo to murder!").</li>
             <li><strong>Prescriptivism (R.M. Hare):</strong> Moral judgments function like universal imperatives or commands ("Murder is wrong" ≈ "Do not murder!").</li>
             <li><strong>Quasi-Realism (Simon Blackburn):</strong> Moral judgments express complex attitudes or dispositions, while mimicking the linguistic structure of factual claims.</li>
             <li><strong>Norm-Expressivism (Allan Gibbard):</strong> Moral judgments express acceptance of systems of norms.</li>
         </ul>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            A major challenge for non-cognitivism is the <strong>Frege-Geach Problem (or Embedding Problem)</strong>. Moral statements appear meaningfully in complex sentences and logical inferences (e.g., "If lying is wrong, then getting your brother to lie is wrong"). Non-cognitivist accounts struggle to explain how terms like "wrong" retain consistent meaning in these embedded contexts if they merely express emotions or commands rather than state propositions. If "lying is wrong" just means "Boo to lying!", what does the conditional premise mean?

             The debate over the connection between moral judgment and motivation (internalism vs. externalism) and the nature of motivation itself (Humean vs. anti-Humean) remains central to meta-ethical discussions between cognitivists and non-cognitivists.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Understanding ethics is vital for cultivating ethical behavior, essential for personal fulfillment and societal well-being. In an interconnected world, ethical considerations are increasingly important. Studying different ethical approaches benefits individuals and society.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Morality involves the principles, values, and customs governing conduct, judged as right/wrong or good/bad. These values help regulate behavior and maintain social stability. Ethics provides the theoretical framework for analyzing and justifying moral beliefs and practices.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            This chapter explored major normative ethical theories: <strong>teleological/consequentialist</strong> theories (like egoism and utilitarianism), which judge actions based on outcomes; <strong>deontological</strong> theories (like Divine Command Theory, Rights Theory, Kantianism, Ross's Prima Facie Duties), which focus on duties, rules, or intentions; and <strong>virtue ethics</strong> (like Aristotle's), which emphasizes character development and virtues. It also introduced <strong>meta-ethics</strong>, which examines the meaning, nature, and justification of moral language and concepts, including debates between cognitivism and non-cognitivism. While canonical theories face critiques, contemporary approaches continue to refine ethical thought, aiming to guide moral decision-making in concrete situations.
