    <h1>How to Email Your Professors</h1>
    <p>Writing an email to your professor requires a balance of formality, clarity, and conciseness. Here are some steps and tips to help you craft a respectful and effective email:</p>

    <h2>Steps and Tips</h2>

    <h3>Use a Professional Email Address</h3>
    <p>Ensure that you use a professional email address, preferably one provided by your educational institution.</p>

    <h3>Subject Line</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Be Specific and Clear:</strong> The subject line should concisely summarize the purpose of your email. For example:
            <ul>
                <li>Question about MCIE1012 Assignment Due Date</li>
                <li>Request for Meeting on Thesis Topic</li>
                <li>Clarification on Lecture Materials from 06/07</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Greeting</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Formal Salutation:</strong> Start with "Dear Professor [Last Name]" or "Hello Professor [Last Name]."</li>
        <li><strong>If unsure about titles:</strong> When in doubt, use "Professor." Avoid using "Mr." or "Ms." unless you are certain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Self-Introduction</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Briefly Introduce Yourself:</strong> If this is your first email to the professor or if they may not remember you, include a short introduction.
            <p>"My name is [Your Full Name] and I am a student in your [Course Name and Number] class."</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>State the Purpose of Your Email</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Be Direct and Clear:</strong> State why you are writing in a clear and concise manner.
            <ul>
                <li>"I am writing to ask for an extension on the assignment due to [reason]."</li>
                <li>"I would like to schedule a meeting to discuss my research project."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Provide Context if Necessary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Give Relevant Details:</strong> If your email requires the professor to refer to previous communications or materials, provide the necessary context.
            <p>"In the lecture on [Date], you mentioned... I am unclear about..."</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ask Specific Questions or Make Specific Requests</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Be Clear and Specific:</strong> Ensure your questions or requests are direct.
            <ul>
                <li>"Could you please clarify the second point of the lecture?"</li>
                <li>"Is it possible to meet on [date and time] to discuss this further?"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Closing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Thank the Professor:</strong> Express gratitude for their time and assistance.
            <p>"Thank you for your help."</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Use a Formal Sign-Off:</strong> Use "Sincerely," "Best regards," or "Thank you," followed by your full name.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Proofread Before Sending</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check for Errors:</strong> Ensure there are no grammatical or spelling mistakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Ensure Politeness and Professional Tone:</strong> Make sure the tone remains respectful and formal throughout the email.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example Email</h2>
    <div class="example-email">
    Subject: Question about BIO101 Assignment Due Date

    Dear Professor Smith,

    My name is Jane Doe and I am a student in your BIO101 class, section 3. I am writing to inquire about the due date for the upcoming assignment on cellular respiration.

    In the syllabus, it states that the assignment is due on June 15th, but during last week's lecture, I believe you mentioned an extension. Could you please confirm the correct due date?

    Thank you for your assistance.

    Best regards,

    Jane Doe
    BIO101, Section 3
    </div>

    <h2>Example of What Not to Do</h2>
    <div class="what-not-to-do">
    Subject: Help!

    Hey Prof,

    I need an extension on the paper. Can I get it? Also, when is the midterm again? And what chapters are we supposed to read? Sorry, I forgot. Thanks.

    Cheers,

    Sam
