    <h2>BASIC CONCEPTS OF CRITICAL THINKING</h2>
    
    <h3>Chapter Overview</h3>
    <p>
        This chapter is about the power of disciplined thinking. It is about learning to think for yourself 
        and being your own person. In many high schools, the emphasis of education tends to be on 
        ―lower-order thinking.‖ Students are simply expected to passively absorb information and then 
        repeat it back on tests. In college and universities, by contrast, the emphasis is on fostering 
        ―higher-order thinking‖: the active, intelligent evaluation of ideas and information. As Martin 
        Luther King Jr rightly puts it, ―The function of education is to teach one to think intensively 
        and to think critically‖. The main goal of teaching Critical Thinking is, therefore, to teach 
        students how to think; that is, how to become independent, self-directed thinkers and learners. 
        It is about the personal empowerment and enrichment that result from learning to use your mind 
        to its fullest potential. In short, it is about critical thinking. In this chapter, we deal with the 
        Meaning, Standards, Principles, Characteristics, Barriers, and Benefits of critical thinking.

    <h1>Lesson 1: Meaning of Critical Thinking</h1>

    <h2>Lesson Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Critical thinking can be defined as a wide range of cognitive skills and intellectual dispositions 
        needed to effectively identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments and truth claims. In this lesson, 
        we will learn the meaning and general picture of critical thinking.
    </p>

    <h3>Lesson Objectives:</h3>
    <p>After the accomplishment of this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Understand</strong> the meaning and general picture of critical thinking.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Critical</strong> means involving or exercising skilled judgment or observation. In this sense, critical 
        thinking means thinking clearly and intelligently. More precisely, critical thinking is the general 
        term given to a wide range of cognitive skills and intellectual dispositions needed to effectively 
        identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments and truth claims. Moreover, it helps to discover and 
        overcome personal preconceptions and biases; to formulate and present convincing reasons in 
        support of conclusions; and to make reasonable, intelligent decisions about what to believe and 
        what to do.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, it does not automatically follow that being intelligent means being able to think critically 
        or reason about information in a useful, effective, and efficient manner. Being smart and 
        intelligent is not sufficient. Critical thinking is a process or journey that helps us to arrive at the 
        most useful, helpful, and most likely destinations when evaluating claims for scientific truth. 
        Critical thinking, thus, is thinking clearly, fairly, rationally, objectively, and independently. It is a 
        process that hopefully leads to an impartial investigation of the data and facts that remains not 
        swayed by irrelevant emotions. Therefore, the aim of critical thinking is to arrive at well-reasoned, 
        considered, and justifiable conclusions.
    </p>

    <p>
        The American philosopher, <strong>John Dewey</strong>, has defined critical thinking as an <em>active, 
        persistent, and careful consideration of a belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds, 
        which support it and the further conclusions to which it tends</em>. In this definition, there are three 
        main points that we should focus on: <strong>active</strong>, <strong>persistent</strong>, and <strong>grounds</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second point is that critical thinking is <em>persistent</em> and <em>careful</em> consideration. Here, Dewey contrasts 
        critical thinking with the kind of unreflective thinking we all sometimes engage in. For example, 
        we sometimes jump to a conclusion or make a quick decision without thinking about it. Of course, 
        sometimes, we may have to do this because we need to decide quickly or the issue is not important 
        enough to warrant careful thought, but we often do it when we ought to stop and think – when we 
        ought to persist a bit.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, the most important point in Dewey's definition lies in what he said about the <em>‘grounds 
        which support’</em> a belief and the <em>‘further conclusions to which it tends’</em>. What Dewey is saying, to 
        express it in more familiar language, is that what matters are the reasons we have for believing 
        something and the implications of our beliefs. It is no exaggeration to say that critical thinking 
        attaches huge importance to reasoning, to giving reasons, and to evaluating reasoning as far as 
        possible. There is more to it than that, but skillful reasoning is a key element.
    </p>

    <p>
        Dewey’s definition, though important, misses some key features of critical thinking. Let us now 
        see the other definition given by <strong>Edward Glaser</strong>. <strong>Edward Glaser</strong> defined critical thinking as: 
        <em>(1) an attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that 
        come within the range of one’s experience; (2) knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry 
        and reasoning; and (3) some skill in applying those methods</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we closely observe Glaser’s definition, it is immediately obvious that this definition owes a lot 
        to Dewey’s original definition. Glaser uses the term <em>‘evidence’</em> in place of <em>‘grounds’</em> but 
        otherwise, the second sentence is much the same. But there are two points that stand out in 
        this definition. The first sentence speaks about an <em>attitude</em> or <em>disposition</em> to be thoughtful about 
        problems and recognizes that you can apply what he calls ‘the methods of logical inquiry and 
        reasoning’ with more or less <em>‘skill’</em>. The tradition has picked up on both these elements, 
        recognizing that critical thinking is partly a matter of having certain thinking skills. But it is not 
        just a matter of having these skills; it is also a matter of being disposed to use them. Critical 
        thinking combines these habits and abilities in approaching and understanding our experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        The other most famous contributors to the development of the critical thinking tradition is <strong>Robert 
        Ennis</strong>. <strong>Robert Ennis</strong> defined critical thinking as: <em>reasonable, reflective thinking 
        that is focused on deciding what to believe or do</em>. Notice that the emphasis on being <em>‘reasonable’</em> and <em>‘reflective’</em> in this 
        definition is similar to the above two definitions. But notice also that Ennis speaks of 
        <em>‘deciding what to do’</em>, which was not explicitly mentioned in the above definitions. So 
        decision-making is an important part of critical thinking in Ennis’s conception. What we learn 
        from Ennis’s definition is that when we make a decision, we should be serious about it. The 
        decision may be about purchasing a phone, or it may be about choosing a department, or any 
        other issue. But we should employ critical thinking to make a decision.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is another important definition of critical thinking given by <strong>Richard Paul</strong>: <em>Critical 
        thinking is that mode of thinking – about any subject, content, or problem – in which the thinker 
        improves the quality of his or her thinking by skillfully taking charge of the structures inherent in 
        thinking and imposing intellectual standards upon them</em>. Paul associates critical thinking with 
        reflecting on thoughts. This definition is interesting and somehow looks different from the other 
        definitions given above. It draws attention to a feature of critical thinking on which scholars in 
        the field seem to be largely agreed - that the only realistic way to develop one’s critical thinking 
        ability is through <em>‘thinking about one’s thinking’</em> (often called <em>‘meta-cognition’</em>), and 
        consciously aiming to improve it by reference to some model of good thinking in that domain.
    </p>

    <p>
        One last definition is worth reviewing. <strong>Michael Scriven</strong> has defined critical thinking as <em>skilled 
        and active interpretation and evaluation of observations and communications, information, and argumentation</em>. 
        He argued that critical thinking is an academic competency akin to reading and 
        writing and is of similarly fundamental importance. It is worth unpacking Scriven’s definition a 
        little. He defines critical thinking as a <em>‘skilled’</em> activity for reasons similar to those mentioned 
        above. He points out that thinking does not count as critical merely because it is intended to be, 
        any more than thinking counts as scientific simply because it aims to be. To be critical, thinking 
        has to meet certain standards (<em>clarity, relevance, reasonableness</em>, and so on), and one may be 
        more or less skilled at this.
    </p>

    <p>
        He defined critical thinking as an <em>‘active’</em> process, partly because it involves questioning and 
        partly because of the role played by <em>meta-cognition</em>. He includes <em>‘interpretation’</em> of texts, 
        speech, film, graphics, actions, and even body language because <em>‘like explanation, interpretation 
        typically involves constructing and selecting the best of several alternatives, and it is a crucial 
        preliminary to drawing conclusions about complex claims’</em>. He includes <em>‘evaluation’</em> because 
        <em>‘this is the process of determining the merit, quality, worth, or value of something’</em> and much 
        critical thinking is concerned with evaluating the truth, probability, or reliability of claims.
    </p>

    <p>
        The above definitions, though may not give an exhaustive definition by themselves, nevertheless, 
        provide an important conception of critical thinking together. Before closing the 
        explication of critical thinking, however, we should focus on the other aspects of critical thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
        Critical thinking is sometimes referred to as <em>‘criticocreative’</em> thinking. This word is the 
        combination of two words: <strong>critical</strong> and <strong>creative</strong>. There are two related reasons for this. The first 
        is that the term critical thinking is sometimes thought to sound rather negative, as though one’s 
        only interest is in adversely criticizing other people’s arguments and ideas. This would be a 
        serious mistake since (and this is the second reason) to be a truly critical thinker requires that 
        one be imaginative and <strong>creative</strong> in order to make sound, useful, and practical judgments.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second reason is that critical thinking and <strong>creative thinking</strong> are inseparable and 
        complementary to each other. One of the important points to note in this regard is that critical 
        thinking itself involves a creative element. When you raise questions about what has been 
        assumed or when you formulate a better hypothesis, you are being <strong>creative</strong> as well as 
        critical.

                        <h1>Lesson 2: Standards of Critical Thinking</h1>

    <h2>Lesson Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Critical thinking is a disciplined thinking governed by clear intellectual standards. But, not every
        thinking is critical. To identify critical thinking from the uncritical, we refer to some standards. 
        There is a consensus among philosophers that for thinking to be critical, it has to meet certain 
        standards. Standard of critical thinking refers to conditions or levels that critical thinking should 
        meet to be considered as normal and acceptable. Among the most important of these intellectual 
        standards are clarity, precision, accuracy, relevance, consistency, logical correctness, 
        completeness, and fairness. In this lesson, we will discuss these standards.
    </p>

    <h2>Lesson Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Recognize the important intellectual standards of critical thinking.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Dear learners, we have seen that the term 'critical thinking' generally refers to a wide range of 
        cognitive skills and intellectual dispositions needed to effectively identify, analyze, and evaluate 
        arguments and truth claims. Critical thinking is a disciplined thinking governed by clear 
        intellectual standards that can be used to identify critical thinking from the uncritical. The standard 
        of critical thinking refers to conditions or levels that critical thinking should meet to be considered 
        normal and acceptable. Clarity, precision, accuracy, relevance, consistency, 
        logical correctness, completeness, and fairness are some of the most important intellectual 
        standards of critical thinking. Let us discuss these standards in detail.
    </p>

    <h2>1) Clarity</h2>
    <p>
        Clarity refers to a clear understanding of concepts and clearly expressing them in language that is 
        free of obscurity and vagueness. When we construct arguments, we should take into consideration 
        or pay close attention to clarity. Before we can effectively evaluate a person's argument or claim, 
        we need to understand clearly what the person is saying. Unfortunately, that can be difficult 
        because people often fail to express themselves clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
        But clarity is a gateway standard. If a statement is unclear, we cannot determine whether it is 
        accurate or relevant. In fact, we cannot tell anything about it because we do not yet know what it 
        is saying. For example, the question "What can be done about the education system in Ethiopia?" 
        is unclear. In order to address the question adequately, we would need to have a clearer 
        understanding of what the person is asking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Critical thinkers strive for clarity of language and seek maximum clarity of thought. To achieve 
        our personal goals in life, we need a clear conception of our goals and priorities, a realistic grasp 
        of our abilities, and a clear understanding of the problems and opportunities we face.
    </p>

    <h2>2) Precision</h2>
    <p>
        Precision is a matter of being exact, accurate, and careful. Most ideas are vague and obscure, 
        though we think we have a precise understanding of them. When we try to meticulously examine 
        these ideas, we find that they are imprecise. To get a precise understanding, we should pay close 
        attention to details. Critical thinkers understand the importance of precise thinking in different 
        contexts.
    </p>

    <h2>3) Accuracy</h2>
    <p>
        Accuracy is about having correct and genuine information. If the ideas and thoughts one processes 
        are not real, then decisions based on wrong and false information will likely result in distorting 
        realities. Critical thinkers value accuracy and strive to ensure their decisions are based on true 
        information.
    </p>

    <h2>4) Relevance</h2>
    <p>
        Relevance refers to the connection between ideas and information. In discussions or debates, only 
        those points that bear on the issue should be raised. Critical thinkers focus on relevant ideas and 
        carefully choose information that has a logical connection to the issue at hand.
    </p>

    <h2>5) Consistency</h2>
    <p>
        Consistency is about the quality of always behaving in the same way or having the same opinions 
        or standards. Critical thinkers value consistency and are constantly on the lookout for 
        inconsistencies in their own thinking and in the arguments of others.
    </p>

    <h2>6) Logical Correctness</h2>
    <p>
        Logical correctness involves reasoning correctly and drawing well-founded conclusions from the 
        beliefs held. Critical thinkers ensure that their thinking is logical, meaning that their thoughts 
        support each other and make sense in combination.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Completeness</h2>
    <p>
        Completeness involves deep and thorough thinking rather than shallow and superficial thinking. 
        Critical thinkers prefer deep and complete thinking whenever possible.
    </p>

    <h2>8) Fairness</h2>
    <p>
        Fairness involves open-mindedness, impartiality, and being free of distorting biases and 
        preconceptions. Critical thinkers strive for fairness in their thinking, recognizing that everyone 
        perceives reality differently due to their individual life experiences and cultural backgrounds.

                        <h1>Lesson 3: Codes of Intellectual Conduct for Effective Discussion</h1>

    <h2>Lesson Overview</h2>
    <p>
        We have learned in chapter two that a good argument is constituted by two or more explicit 
        and/or implicit claims, one or more of which supports or provides evidence for the truth or merit 
        of another claim, the conclusion. We have also seen in the previous lesson that critical thinking 
        is disciplined thinking that provides a wide range of cognitive skills and intellectual dispositions 
        needed to effectively identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments and truth claims; and governed 
        by clear intellectual standards that can be used to identify critical thinking from the uncritical. 
        But the question is: how can we measure the goodness or badness of an argument? And how 
        is it that some thinking is critical and some is not? In this lesson, we will discuss the basic codes 
        of intellectual conduct, especially the common principles of a good argument and critical thinking.

    </ul>

    <h3>3.1 Principles of Good Argument</h3>
    <p>
        A discussion may involve two or more participants, or it may simply be an internal discussion 
        with oneself. In either case, one who wishes to construct the strongest possible arguments for his 
        or her views and to do their part in resolving conflicts concerning issues that matter should 
        make each of the following principles a part of their intellectual style:
    </p>

    <h3>1) The Structural Principle</h3>
    <p>
        The structural principle of a good argument requires that one who argues for or against a position 
        should use an argument that meets the fundamental structural requirements of a well-formed
        argument. Such an argument does not use reasons that contradict each other, contradict the 
        conclusion, or explicitly or implicitly assume the truth of the conclusion. Neither does it 
        draw any invalid deductive inferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first criterion used in determining whether an argument is a good one is the requirement that 
        it be structurally sound. An argument must look and work like an argument. In other words, it 
        should be formed in such a way that the conclusion either follows necessarily from its premises, 
        in the case of deductive arguments, or follows probably from its premises, in the case of 
        inductive arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
        A good argument should also provide us with reasons to believe that the conclusion deserves our 
        acceptance. Since most discussions about controversial issues are initiated because the 
        argument’s conclusion has not yet been accepted by all participants, the arguer will use premises 
        that are more likely to be accepted than the conclusion. If those premises are accepted and they 
        lead to the conclusion, it is more likely that the conclusion will also be accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another structural feature of an argument that could render it fatally flawed would be one whose 
        premises are incompatible with one another. An argument that has such premises is one from 
        which any conclusion, no matter how outrageous, can be drawn. The fact that an argument with 
        incompatible premises may yield an absurd result demonstrates that it cannot even function as an 
        argument—let alone a good one. It certainly cannot help us decide what to do or believe. The 
        same is true of an argument with a conclusion that contradicts one of the premises. A conclusion 
        that contradicts another claim in the same argument violates the law of non-contradiction.
    </p>

    <h3>2) The Relevance Principle</h3>
    <p>
        This is the second principle of a good argument that requires that one who presents an argument 
        for or against a position should set forth only reasons whose truth provides some evidence for the 
        truth of the conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
        The premises of a good argument must be relevant to the truth or merit of the conclusion. There 
        is no reason to waste time assessing the truth or acceptability of a premise if it is not even 
        relevant to the truth of the conclusion. A premise is relevant if its acceptance provides some 
        reason to believe, counts in favor of, or has some bearing on the truth or merit of the conclusion. 
        A premise is irrelevant if its acceptance has no bearing on, provides no evidence for, or has no 
        connection to the truth or merit of the conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may want to ask two questions in an effort to determine whether a particular premise or 
        reason is relevant. First, would the premise's being true in any way make one more likely to 
        believe that the conclusion is true? If the answer is yes, the premise is probably relevant. If the 
        answer is no, the premise is probably not relevant. Second, even if the premise is true, should it 
        be a consideration in the determination of whether or not the conclusion of the argument is true? 
        For example, does the fact that an idea is widely accepted by most people signify that the idea itself is good? If the answer is no, then a premise that asserts that claim is 
        irrelevant. If the answer is yes, which is unlikely in this case, then the premise should be 
        regarded as relevant.
    </p>

    <h3>3) The Acceptability Principle</h3>
    <p>
        The third principle of a good argument is the acceptability principle. This principle requires that 
        one who presents an argument for or against a position should provide reasons that are likely to 
        be accepted by a mature, rational person and that meet standard criteria of acceptability. The 
        reasons set forth in support of a conclusion must be acceptable. A reason is acceptable if it is the 
        kind of claim that a rational person would accept in the face of all the relevant evidence 
        available.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some people believe that the acceptability principle should be replaced by the truth 
        principle to connote the idea that premises should be true to be acceptable. However, the term 
        "acceptable" is preferable to the more traditional term "true" for several reasons. 
    </p>
    <p>
        First, the notion of acceptability stems from the very nature of argumentative interchange. In 
        most argumentative situations, the key to achieving agreement on the conclusion is achieving 
        acceptance of the premises. The arguer typically starts with premises that the skeptic is likely to 
        accept or that a rational person ought to accept. Upon acceptance of the premises, assuming that 
        other criteria of a good argument are satisfied, the opponent is logically led to the acceptance of 
        the conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, since it is notoriously difficult to establish the absolute truth of any statement, it would 
        be an impractical requirement of a good argument that its premises must be true in any absolute 
        sense. Indeed, if such a condition were enforced, there would be very few good arguments. The 
        most that we can legitimately expect is what a reasonable person would accept as true.
    </p>
    <p>
        Third, an analysis of our language suggests that in many ordinary contexts, what we typically
        mean by the word "true" would be more appropriately expressed by the phrase "accepted as 
        true." Consider, for example, the contradictory testimony from courtroom witnesses, each of 
        whom is allegedly telling the truth. A better way to describe what is happening there is that each 
        witness is presumably telling what he or she honestly accepts as true. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Fourth, even if a premise were true in the absolute sense, it may be unacceptable to a particular 
        audience because that audience may not be in a position to determine its truth. For example, the 
        evidence for a premise may be inaccessible to them in that it is too technical for them to 
        understand. The truth of the premise would therefore not add anything to the practical force of 
        the argument. An argument can be a good one only if the premises are accepted or recognized as 
        true.
    </p>

    <h3>4) The Sufficiency Principle</h3>
    <p>
        The fourth principle of a good argument is the sufficiency principle, which requires that one who 
        presents an argument for or against a position should provide reasons that are sufficient in 
        number, kind, and weight to justify the acceptance of the conclusion. In addition, a good 
        argument must satisfy the sufficiency criterion. In other words, the premises must be sufficient 
        in number and kind to justify the conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some arguments are based on irrelevant reasons, and they cannot satisfy the relevance principle. 
        However, an argument with relevant reasons that are simply insufficient in number, kind, or 
        weight may satisfy the relevance principle but fail to meet the sufficiency principle.

    <h2>3.2 Principles of Critical Thinking</h2>
    <p>Having discussed the major principles of a good argument, let us now see the principles of a critical thinking as parts of the codes of intellectual conduct.</p>
    
    <h3>1) The Fallibility Principle</h3>
    <p>The first principle of critical thinking is the fallibility principle. This principle requires that each participant in a discussion of a disputed issue should be willing to accept the fact that he or she is fallible, which means that one must acknowledge that one’s own initial view may not be the most defensible position on the question.</p>
    <p>To employ the fallibility principle in a discussion is consciously to accept the fact that you are fallible, that is, that your present view may be wrong or not the most defensible view on the matter in dispute. If you refuse to accept your own fallibility, you are, in effect, saying that you are not willing to change your mind, even if you hear a better argument. This is pretty strong evidence that you do not intend to play fairly, and there is no real point in continuing the discussion. An admission of fallibility, however, is a positive sign that you are genuinely interested in the kind of honest inquiry that may lead to a fair resolution of the issue. Given the great number of issues that divide us and the large number of different positions on each of those issues, it is more likely that a person would turn out to be wrong on more issues than right.</p>
    
    <h3>2) The Truth Seeking Principle</h3>
    <p>The second principle of critical thinking is the truth seeking principle. This principle requires that each participant should be committed to the task of earnestly searching for the truth or at least the most defensible position on the issue at stake. Therefore, one should be willing to examine alternative positions seriously, look for insights in the positions of others, and allow other participants to present arguments for or raise objections to any position held on an issue.</p>
    <p>The search for truth is a lifelong endeavor, which principally takes the form of discussion, wherein we systematically entertain the ideas and arguments of fellow seekers after truth, while at the same time thoughtfully considering criticisms of our own views. If we really are interested in finding the truth, it is imperative not only that we assume that we may not now have the truth, but that we listen to the arguments for alternative positions and encourage criticism of our own arguments.</p>
    <p>We probably all want to hold only those opinions that really are true, but the satisfaction of that interest comes at a price - a willingness to look at all available options and the arguments in support of them. Otherwise, we might miss the truth completely. The problem, of course, is that most of us want the truth to be what we now hold to be the truth.</p>
    
    <h3>3) The Clarity Principle</h3>
    <p>The clarity principle is the third principle of critical thinking. It requires that the formulations of all positions, defenses, and attacks should be free of any kind of linguistic confusion and clearly separated from other positions and issues. Any successful discussion of an issue must be carried on in language that all the parties involved can understand. Even if what we have to say is perfectly clear to ourselves, others may not be able to understand us. A position or a criticism of it that is expressed in confusing, vague, ambiguous, or contradictory language will not reach those toward whom it is directed, and it will contribute little to resolving the issue at hand.</p>
    
    <h3>4) The Burden of Proof Principle</h3>
    <p>The fourth principle of critical thinking is the burden of proof principle. This principle requires that the burden of proof for any position usually rests on the participant who sets forth the position. If, and when, an opponent asks, the proponent should provide an argument for that position.</p>
    <p>Just as a person is generally held accountable for his or her own actions, one who makes a positive or negative claim about something has what is called the burden of proof. In many cases, of course, one does not have to supply such proof, for we are not always challenged to defend our claims. But if the claimant is asked “Why?” or “How do you know that is true?” he or she is logically obligated to produce reasons on behalf of the claim. An exception to this rule is a situation in which the claim in question is well established or uncontroversial. In such a case, the burden of proof might rest on the one who wishes to challenge that claim. One has the responsibility to provide evidence for one’s conclusion and for any questionable premise, if asked to do so.</p>
    <p>To ask others to accept your claim without any support, or to shift the burden of proof to them by suggesting that your position is true unless they can prove otherwise, is to commit the fallacy of “arguing from ignorance,” for you are, in this way, making a claim based on no evidence at all.</p>
    
    <h3>5) The Principle of Charity</h3>
    <p>This is the fifth principle of critical thinking that requires that if a participant’s argument is reformulated by an opponent, it should be carefully expressed in its strongest possible version that is consistent with what is believed to be the original intention of the arguer. If there is any question about that intention or about any implicit part of the argument, the arguer should be given the benefit of any doubt in the reformulation and/or, when possible, given the opportunity to amend it.</p>
    <p>Good discussion in general and argumentation in particular impose an ethical requirement on their participants. But there is also a practical reason for being fair with one another’s arguments. If we deliberately create and then attack a weak version of the original argument, we will probably fail to achieve the very goals that discussion is designed to serve. If we are really interested in the truth or the best answer to a problem, then we will want to evaluate the best version of any argument set forth in support of one of the options. Hence, if we don’t deal with the best version now, we will eventually have to do so, once an uncharitable version has been corrected by the arguer or others. We would do well, then, to be fair about it in the first place by letting our opponents amend any portion of our reconstruction of their arguments.</p>
    
    <h3>6) The Suspension of Judgment Principle</h3>
    <p>The sixth principle of critical thinking is the suspension of judgment principle. This principle requires that if no position is defended by a good argument, or if two or more positions seem to be defended with equal strength, one should, in most cases, suspend judgment about the issue. If practical considerations seem to require a more immediate decision, one should weigh the relative benefits or harm connected with the consequences of suspending judgment and decides the issue on those grounds.</p>
    <p>If suitable evidence is so lacking that one has no good basis for making a decision either way, it may be quite appropriate to suspend judgment on the matter and wait until there is more of a basis for decision. This alternative should not, however, be seen as a clever way to avoid the psychological fright of making a difficult decision or of moving into unfamiliar territory.</p>
    
    <h3>7) The Resolution Principle</h3>
    <p>The last principle of critical thinking is the resolution principle. This principle requires that an issue should be considered resolved if the argument for one of the alternative positions is a structurally sound, one that uses relevant and acceptable reasons that together provide sufficient grounds to justify the conclusion and that also include an effective rebuttal to all serious criticisms of the argument and/or the position it supports. Unless one can demonstrate that the argument has not met these conditions more successfully than any argument presented for alternative positions, one is obligated to accept its conclusion and consider the issue to be settled.</p>
    <p>If the argument is subsequently found by any participant to be flawed in a way that raises new doubts about the merit of the position it supports, one is obligated to reopen the issue for further consideration and resolution.</p>
    <p>If the purpose of rational discussion is ultimately to decide what to do or believe, then coming to closure should happen more often than it does. There are many good arguments out there, and if good arguments resolve issues, why are not more issues resolved? How much more discussion is needed, just because some refuse to recognize the force of a good argument? Unfortunately, very few controversial issues ever come to rational resolution. If you have doubts about this, then ask yourself when the last time was that you allowed the force of argument to change your mind about an important issue - even though changing one’s mind in the face of a good argument should not be a difficult thing to do for a genuine truth-seeker. So why does it not happen? Why are issues not resolved? There are probably a number of reasons. It could be that one of the parties to the dispute has a blind spot; that is, he or she simply cannot be objective about the particular issue at hand. Or maybe he or she has been rationally but not psychologically convinced by the discussion. Another possible explanation is that one or more of the parties in the dispute have been rationally careless or at least guilty of not thinking as clearly as they should. It is even possible that one of the parties has a hidden agenda - an issue to defend other than the stated one. Or maybe the parties involved are simply not being honest with themselves, for they may want to win the argument more than they want to find a solution to the problem. Finally, perhaps the parties are in what might be called deep disagreement. In other words, they are divided on the issue because of fundamental underlying assumptions that have yet to be explored.</p>
    <p>No argument, however, being regarded as permanently successful. There is always the possibility that new evidence will come to light that will raise new doubts about a position hold on what were thought to be good grounds. Under these conditions, further examination is always appropriate. Pride in holding a position defended by a good argument in the past should not become an obstacle to reopening the issue in the present if conditions warrant it. The new doubts, however, should not be the same old doubts in new clothing. Reopening the issue should come only as a consequence of uncovering new or reinterpreted evidence not considered in the earlier treatment of the issue.</p>

    <h2>Lesson 4: Characteristics of Critical Thinking</h2>
    
    <h3>Lesson Overview</h3>
    <p>So far, in this chapter, we have discussed the meaning and nature of critical thinking; standards of critical thinking, codes of intellectual conduct: the principles of good arguments and critical thinking. With this as background, we are now in a position to offer general characteristics of critical thinking.</p>
    
    <h3>Lesson Objectives:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Appreciate the general characteristics of critical thinking.</li>
        <li>Understand the characteristics of a critical and uncritical thinker.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Dear learners, we have defined critical thinking generally as a wide range of cognitive skills and intellectual dispositions needed to effectively identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments and truth claims. What then distinguishes a critical thinker from the uncritical one? Let us discuss some characteristics of Critical and Uncritical Thinkers.</p>
<h3>4.1 Basic Traits of Critical Thinkers</h3>
    <p>A critical thinker simply is a person who exhibits some features of critical thinking. There are some dispositions and attitudes, skills and abilities, habits and values that every critical person should manifest. In this section, we will see some of the key intellectual traits of critical thinkers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Are honest with themselves, acknowledging what they don't know, recognizing their limitations, and being watchful of their own errors.</li>
        <li>Regard problems and controversial issues as exciting challenges. Strive for understanding, keep curiosity alive, remain patient with complexity, and are ready to invest time to overcome confusion.</li>
        <li>Base judgments on evidence rather than personal preferences, deferring judgment whenever evidence is insufficient. They revise judgments when new evidence reveals error.</li>
        <li>Are interested in other people's ideas and so are willing to read and listen attentively, even when they tend to disagree with the other person.</li>
        <li>Recognize that extreme views (whether conservative or liberal) are seldom correct, so they avoid them, practice fair-mindedness, and seek a balanced view.</li>
        <li>Practice restraint, controlling their feelings rather than being controlled by them, and thinking before acting.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>4.2 Basic Traits of Uncritical Thinkers</h3>
    <p>We have in the previous section that every critical person manifests some dispositions and attitudes, skills and abilities, habits and values. What about the uncritical thinker? In this section, we will see some traits of uncritical thinkers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pretend they know more than they do, ignore their limitations, and assume their views are error-free.</li>
        <li>Regard problems and controversial issues as nuisances or threats to their ego.</li>
        <li>Are impatient with complexity and thus would rather remain confused than make the effort to understand.</li>
        <li>Base judgments on first impressions and gut reactions. They are unconcerned about the amount or quality of evidence and cling to their views steadfastly.</li>
        <li>Are preoccupied with themselves and their own opinions, and so are unwilling to pay attention to others' views. At the first sign of disagreement, they tend to think, "How can I refute this?"</li>
        <li>Ignore the need for balance and give preference to views that support their established views.</li>
        <li>Tend to follow their feelings and act impulsively.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Let us now compare and contrast the key intellectual traits of critical thinkers with the relevant traits of uncritical thinkers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity and Precision:</strong> Critical thinkers have a passionate drive for clarity, precision, accuracy, and other critical thinking standards, while uncritical thinkers often think in ways that are unclear, imprecise, and inaccurate. Critical thinkers are sensitive to ways in which critical thinking can be skewed by egocentrism, sociocentrism, wishful thinking, and other impediments, while uncritical thinkers often fall prey to egocentrism, sociocentrism, relativistic thinking, unwarranted assumptions, and wishful thinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Understanding and Evaluation:</strong> Critical thinkers are skilled at understanding, analyzing, and evaluating arguments and viewpoints, whereas uncritical thinkers often misunderstand or evaluate unfairly arguments and viewpoints. Moreover, critical thinkers reason logically, draw appropriate conclusions from evidence and data, while uncritical thinkers are illogical, and draw unsupported conclusions from these sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Intellectual Honesty:</strong> Critical thinkers are intellectually honest with themselves, acknowledging what they do not know and recognizing their limitations, while uncritical thinkers pretend they know more than they do and ignore their limitations. Furthermore, critical thinkers listen open-mindedly to opposing points of view, welcome criticisms of beliefs and assumptions, whereas uncritical thinkers are closed-minded, and resist criticisms of beliefs and assumptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Beliefs and Evidence:</strong> Critical thinkers base their beliefs on facts and evidence rather than on personal preferences or self-interests, while uncritical thinkers often base beliefs on mere personal preferences or self-interests. Again, critical thinkers are aware of the biases and preconceptions that shape the way they perceive the world, whereas uncritical thinkers lack awareness of their own biases and preconceptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Independence and Courage:</strong> Critical thinkers think independently and are not afraid to disagree with group opinion, whereas uncritical thinkers tend to engage in “groupthink” uncritically following the beliefs and values of the crowd. Moreover, critical thinkers have the intellectual courage to face and assess fairly ideas that challenge even their most basic beliefs, whereas uncritical thinkers fear and resist ideas that challenge their basic beliefs.</li>
        <li><strong>Curiosity and Perseverance:</strong> Critical thinkers pursue truth, are curious about a wide range of issues, and have the intellectual perseverance to pursue insights or truths despite obstacles or difficulties, whereas uncritical thinkers are often relatively indifferent to truth and lack curiosity, tend not to persevere when they encounter intellectual obstacles or difficulties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson 5: Barriers to Critical Thinking</h2>
    <h3>Lesson Overview</h3>
    <p>It is said that critical thinking is a disciplined thinking that provides a wide range of cognitive skills and intellectual dispositions needed to effectively identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments and truth claims; and is governed by clear intellectual standards that can be used to distinguish critical thinking from uncritical thinking. But if critical thinking is so important, why is uncritical thinking so common? Why do so many people, including many highly educated and intelligent individuals, find critical thinking so difficult? The reasons are quite complex. In this lesson, we will discuss some of the problems that impede critical thinking. We will limit our discussion to four of them: egocentrism, sociocentrism, unwarranted assumptions, and stereotype and relativistic thinking. This is not an exhaustive list; many factors impede critical thinking.</p>
    
    <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify and define the major barriers to critical thinking.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Lesson Overview</h3>
    <p>Dear learners, there are a number of factors that impede critical thinking. Some of the most common barriers to critical thinking include: Lack of relevant background information, poor reading skills, bias, prejudice, superstition, egocentrism (self-centered thinking), sociocentrism (group-centered thinking), peer pressure, conformism, provincialism (narrow, unsophisticated thinking), narrow-mindedness, closed-mindedness, distrust in reason, relativistic thinking, stereotyping, unwarranted assumptions, scapegoating (blaming the innocent), and rationalization (inventing excuses to avoid facing our real motives).</p>
    <p>Let us examine in detail five of these impediments that play an especially powerful role in hindering critical thinking: egocentrism, sociocentrism, unwarranted assumptions, relativistic thinking, and wishful thinking.</p>
    
    <h3>1. Egocentrism</h3>
    <p>One of the most powerful barriers to critical thinking is egocentrism. Even highly educated and intelligent people are prey to egocentrism. Egocentrism is the tendency to see reality as centered on oneself. Egocentrics are selfish, self-absorbed people who view their interests, ideas, and values as superior to everyone else’s. All of us are affected to some degree by egocentric biases. Egocentrism can manifest itself in a variety of ways. Two common forms of this are self-interested thinking and the superiority bias.</p>
    <p>Self-interested thinking is the tendency to accept and defend beliefs that harmonize with one’s self-interest. Almost no one is immune to self-interested thinking. For example, most doctors support legislation making it more difficult for them to be sued for malpractice because they do not want to be punished for mistakes committed in the workplace. Most university professors strongly support tenure, paid sabbaticals, low teaching loads, and a strong faculty voice in university governance because these will promote their interests. Most factory workers support laws requiring advance notice of plant closings; most factory owners do not. Some of these beliefs may be supported by good reasons, but self-interest plays at least some role in shaping these attitudes and beliefs.</p>
    <p>Self-interested thinking, however understandable it may seem, is a major obstacle to critical thinking. Everyone finds it tempting at times to reason that “this benefits me, therefore it must be good”; but from a critical thinking standpoint, such “reasoning” is a sham. Critical thinking condemns such special pleading. It demands that we weigh evidence and arguments objectively and impartially. Superiority bias (also known as illusory superiority or the better-than-average effect) is the tendency to overrate oneself - to see oneself as better in some respect than one actually is. If you are like most people, you probably think of yourself as being an unusually self-aware person who is largely immune from any such self-deception. If so, you too are probably suffering from superiority bias.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Sociocentrism</h3>
    <p>The second powerful barrier that paralyzes the critical thinking ability of most people, including intellectuals, is sociocentrism. Sociocentrism is group-centered thinking. Just as egocentrism can hinder rational thinking by focusing excessively on the self, so sociocentrism can hinder rational thinking by focusing excessively on the group. Sociocentrism can distort critical thinking in many ways. Two of the most important are group bias and conformism.</p>
    <p>Group bias is the tendency to see one’s own group (nation, tribe, sect, peer group, and the like) as being inherently better than others. Social scientists tell us that such thinking is extremely common throughout human history and across cultures. Just as we seem naturally inclined to hold inflated views of ourselves, so we find it easy to hold inflated views of our family, our community, or our nation. Conversely, we find it easy to look with suspicion or disfavor on those we regard as “outsiders.” Most people absorb group bias unconsciously, usually from early childhood. For example, people may grow up thinking that their society’s beliefs, institutions, and values are better than those of other societies. Although most people outgrow nationalistic biases to some extent, few manage to outgrow them completely. This “mine-is-better” thinking lies at the root of a great deal of human conflict, intolerance, and oppression.</p>
    <p>Conformism refers to our tendency to follow the crowd - that is, to conform (often unthinkingly) to authority or to group standards of conduct and belief. The desire to belong, to be part of the in-group, can be among the most powerful of human motivations. This desire can seriously cripple our powers of critical reasoning and decision-making. Authority moves us. We are impressed, influenced, and intimidated by authority to the extent that, under the right conditions, we abandon our own values, beliefs, and judgments, even doubting our own immediate experiences. As critical thinkers, we need to be aware of the seductive power of peer pressure and reliance on authority and develop habits of independent thinking to combat them.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Unwarranted Assumptions and Stereotypes</h3>
    <p>The third factor that impedes critical thinking is unwarranted assumptions and stereotypes. An assumption is something we take for granted - something we believe to be true without any proof or conclusive evidence. Almost everything we think and do is based on assumptions. For example, if the weather report calls for rain, we take an umbrella because we assume that the meteorologist is not lying and that the report is based on a scientific analysis of weather patterns. Although we have no proof that this is true, it is wiser to take the umbrella than to demand exhaustive evidence to justify its prediction.</p>
    <p>Although we often hear the injunction “Don’t assume,” it would be impossible to get through a day without making assumptions. Many of our daily actions are based on assumptions drawn from our experience. Unwarranted assumptions, however, are unreasonable. An unwarranted assumption is something taken for granted without good reason. Such assumptions often prevent us from seeing things clearly. One of the most common types of unwarranted assumptions is a stereotype. Stereotypes involve assuming that all individuals within a group are alike, leading to misleading or false conclusions.</p>
    <p>Typically, stereotypes are arrived at through a process known as hasty generalization, where a conclusion about a large class of things (in this case, people) is drawn from a small sample. Media, advertisements, and movies often encourage stereotyping by portraying groups of people in a generalized way. It is important to become conscious of our tendency to stereotype, particularly when basing important attitudes, actions, and decisions on such assumptions.</p>
    
    <h2>4) Relativistic Thinking</h2>
    <p>One of the strongest challenges to critical thinking is relativistic thinking. Relativism is the view that truth is a matter of opinion. There are two popular forms of relativism: subjectivism and cultural relativism.</p>
    <p><strong>Subjectivism</strong> is the view that truth is a matter of individual opinion. According to subjectivism, whatever an individual believes is true, is true for that person, and there is no such thing as “objective” or “absolute” truth, i.e., truth that exists independent of what anyone believes. For example, suppose Abdella believes that abortion is wrong and Obang believes that abortion is not always wrong. According to subjectivism, abortion is always wrong for Abdella and not always wrong for Obang. Both beliefs are true – for them. And truth for one individual or another is the only kind of truth there is.</p>
    <p>The other common form of relativism is <strong>cultural relativism</strong>. This is the view that truth is a matter of social or cultural opinion. In other words, cultural relativism is the view that what is true for person A is what person A's culture or society believes is true. Drinking wine, for example, is widely considered to be wrong in Iran but is not generally considered to be wrong in France. According to cultural relativism, therefore, drinking wine is immoral in Iran but is morally permissible in France. Thus, for the cultural relativist, just as for the subjectivist, there is no objective or absolute standard of truth. What is true is whatever most people in a society or culture believe to be true.</p>
    <p>Relatively few people endorse subjectivism or cultural relativism in the pure, unqualified forms in which we have stated them. Almost everybody would admit, for example, that 1 + 1 = 2 is true, no matter who might be ignorant or deluded enough to deny it. What relativists usually claim, therefore, is not that all truth is relative, but that truth is relative in some important domain(s).</p>
    <p>By far the most common form of relativism is <strong>moral relativism</strong>. Like relativism generally, moral relativism comes in two major forms: moral subjectivism and cultural moral relativism. Moral subjectivism is the view that what is morally right and good for an individual, A, is whatever A believes is morally right and good. Thus, if G/Meskel believes that premarital sex is always wrong, and Eden believes that it is not always wrong; according to moral subjectivism, premarital sex is always wrong for G/Meskel and is not always wrong for Eden.</p>
    <p>The other major form of moral relativism is <strong>cultural moral relativism</strong>, the view that what is morally right and good for an individual, A, is whatever A’s society or culture believes is morally right and good. Thus, according to cultural moral relativism, if culture A believes that polygamy is wrong, and culture B believes that polygamy is right, then polygamy is wrong for culture A and right for culture B. Cultural moral relativism is a very popular view. There are two major reasons people seem to find it so attractive. One has to do with the nature of moral disagreement and the other concerns the value of tolerance.</p>
    <p>Ethics, obviously, is very different from mathematics or science. In mathematics and science, there are arguments and disagreements, but not nearly to the extent there are in ethics. In ethics, there is widespread disagreement, the disagreements often go very deep, and there seems to be no rational way to resolve many of them. What this shows, some people conclude, is that there is no objective truth in ethics; morality is just a matter of individual or societal opinion.</p>
    <p>Another reason people find cultural moral relativism attractive is that it seems to support the value of tolerance. Throughout history, terrible wars, persecutions, and acts of religious and cultural imperialism have been perpetrated by people who firmly believed in the absolute righteousness of their moral beliefs and practices. Cultural moral relativism seems to imply that we must be tolerant of other cultures’ moral beliefs and values. If culture A believes that polygamy is wrong, and culture B believes that it is right, then culture A must agree that polygamy is right for culture B, no matter how offensive the practice may be to culture A.</p>
    <p>Despite these apparent attractions, however, there are deep problems with cultural moral relativism. First, does the fact that there is deep disagreement in ethics show that there is no objective moral truth - that ethics is just a matter of opinion? Think about another area in which there is deep, pervasive, and seemingly irresolvable disagreement: religion. People disagree vehemently over whether God exists, whether there is an afterlife, and so forth; yet we do not conclude from this that there is no objective truth about these matters. It may be difficult to know whether God exists. But whether he exists is not simply a matter of opinion. Thus, deep disagreement about an issue does not show that there is no objective truth about that issue.</p>
    <p>Second, cultural moral relativism does not necessarily support the value of tolerance. Relativism tells us that we should accept the customs and values of our society. Thus, if you live in an intolerant society, relativism implies that you too should be intolerant. Does this mean that cultural moral relativism has nothing at all to teach us? No. The fact that people disagree so much about ethics does not show that moral truth is simply a matter of opinion, but it should make us cautious and open-minded regarding our own ethical beliefs. If millions of obviously decent, intelligent people disagree with you, how can you be sure that your values are the correct ones?</p>
    <p>In this way, relativism can teach us an important lesson about the value of intellectual humility. But we do not need relativism - which is a false and confused theory - to teach us this lesson. We can learn it just by opening our hearts and minds and thinking critically about the challenges of living an ethical life.</p>

    <h2>5) Wishful Thinking</h2>
    <p>Wishful thinking refers to a state of believing something not because you had good evidence for it but simply because you wished it were true. Have you ever been guilty of wishful thinking? If so, you are not alone. Throughout human history, reason has done battle with wishful thinking and has usually come out the loser. People fear the unknown and invent comforting myths to render the universe less hostile and more predictable. They fear death and listen credulously to stories of healing crystals, quack cures, and communication with the dead. They fantasize about possessing extraordinary personal powers and accept uncritically accounts of psychic prediction and levitation.</p>

                        <h1>Lesson 6: Benefits of Critical Thinking</h1>

    <h2>Lesson Overview</h2>
    <p>Being a critical person in general and critical thinking in particular has many benefits. In this lesson, we will discuss some benefits of critical thinking.</p>

    <h2>Lesson Objectives</h2>
    <p>After the accomplishment of this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the major benefits of critical thinking.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Critical Thinking: Skills and Dispositions</h2>
    <p>Critical thinking teaches you how to raise and identify fundamental questions and problems in the community. It will teach you to reformulate these problems clearly and precisely. It will teach you how to gather and assess relevant information, develop reasoned conclusions and solutions, testing them against relevant criterion and standards. It teaches you how to be open-minded to alternative systems of thought, recognize and assess your own assumptions, implications, and practical consequences, and how to communicate effectively with others in figuring out solutions to complex problems.</p>
    <p>Critical thinking is what university is all about. University is not only about teaching students with facts; it’s about teaching students to think critically. This chapter will introduce you to the skills and dispositions you need to become an independent, self-directed thinker and learner. But you’ll only get out of this course what you put into it. Becoming a critical thinker is hard work. Becoming a master thinker means toning up your mental muscles and acquiring habits of careful, disciplined thinking. This requires effort and practice. Critical thinking is an adventure. Becoming mentally fit is hard work. But in the end, you’ll be a smarter, stronger, more confident thinker. Let us consider, more specifically, what you can expect to gain from a course in critical thinking.</p>

    <h2>Critical Thinking in the Classroom</h2>
    <p>When they first enter university, students are sometimes surprised to discover that university education seems less interested in how beliefs are acquired than they are in whether those beliefs can withstand critical scrutiny. The question is not much about what you know, but how you acquire what you know and whether your ideas stand up to critical examination.</p>
    <p>In university, the focus is on higher-order thinking: the active, intelligent evaluation of ideas and information. For this reason, critical thinking plays a vital role in universities. In a critical thinking chapter, students learn a variety of skills that can greatly improve their classroom performance. These skills include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understanding the arguments and beliefs of others.</li>
        <li>Critically evaluating those arguments and beliefs.</li>
        <li>Developing and defending one’s own well-supported arguments and beliefs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To succeed in university, you must, of course, be able to understand the material you are studying. A course in critical thinking cannot make inherently difficult material easy to grasp, but critical thinking does teach a variety of skills that, with practice, can significantly improve your ability to understand the arguments and issues discussed in your college textbooks and classes.</p>
    <p>In addition, critical thinking can help you critically evaluate what you are learning in class. During your university career, your instructors will often ask you to discuss “critically” some argument or idea introduced in class. Critical thinking teaches a wide range of strategies and skills that can greatly improve your ability to engage in such critical evaluation.</p>
    <p>You will also be asked to develop your own arguments on particular topics or issues. In moral and civic education class, for example, you might be asked to write a paper addressing the issue of whether ethnic federalism is good or bad. To write such a paper successfully, you must do more than simply find and assess relevant arguments and information. You must also be able to marshal arguments and evidence in a way that convincingly supports your view. The systematic training provided in a course in critical thinking can greatly improve that skill as well.</p>
    <p>Critical thinking is a transferable thinking skill. These skills will be taught in ways that expressly aim to facilitate their transfer to other subjects and contexts. If you learn how to structure arguments, judge the credibility of sources, or make a reasonable decision by the methods of critical thinking, it will not be difficult to see how to do these things in many other contexts such as in classrooms and personal life; this is the sense in which the skills we teach in this text are transferable.</p>

    <h2>Critical Thinking in Life</h2>
    <p>Critical thinking is valuable in many contexts outside the classroom. Let us look briefly at three ways in which this is the case:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Decision-Making:</strong> Critical thinking can help us avoid making foolish personal decisions. All of us have at one time or another made decisions about what profession to choose, what relationships to enter into, what personal behavior to develop, and the like that we later realized were seriously misguided or irrational. Critical thinking can help us avoid such mistakes by teaching us to think about important life decisions more carefully, clearly, and logically.</li>
        <li><strong>Promoting Democratic Processes:</strong> In democracy, it is the people who have the ultimate say over who governs and for what purposes. Citizens should vote, evaluate different public policies, and collectively determine their fate. It is vital, therefore, that citizens’ decisions be as informed and as rational as possible. Many of today’s most serious societal problems—such as environmental destruction, poverty, ethnic conflicts, decaying morality, high levels of corruption, violating basic human rights, and displacement—have largely been caused by poor critical thinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Enrichment:</strong> Critical thinking is worth studying for its own sake, simply for the personal enrichment it can bring to our lives. One of the most basic truths of the human condition is that most people, most of the time, believe what they are told. Throughout most of recorded history, people accepted without question that the earth was the center of the universe, that demons cause disease, that slavery was just, and that women are inferior to men. Critical thinking, honestly and courageously pursued, can help free us from the unexamined assumptions and biases of our upbringing and our society. It lets us step back from the prevailing customs and ideologies of our culture and ask, “This is what I’ve been taught, but is it true?” In short, critical thinking allows us to lead self-directed, “examined” lives. Such personal liberation is, as the word itself implies, the ultimate goal of education. Whatever other benefits it brings, education can have no greater reward.</li>

                        <h1>Chapter Summary</h1>
    <p>Critical also means, “involving or exercising skilled judgment or observation.” In this sense, critical thinking means thinking clearly and intelligently. More precisely, critical thinking is the general term given to a wide range of cognitive skills and intellectual dispositions needed to effectively identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments and truth claims; to discover and overcome personal preconceptions and biases; to formulate and present convincing reasons in support of conclusions; and to make reasonable, intelligent decisions about what to believe and what to do.</p>
    <p>It does not automatically follow that being intelligent means the student can think critically or reason about information in a useful, effective, and efficient manner. Critical thinking is a process. It is also a journey that helps us to arrive at the most useful, helpful, and most likely destinations when evaluating claims for scientific truth. Critical thinking, thus, is thinking clearly, thinking fairly, thinking rationally, thinking objectively, and thinking independently. It is a process that hopefully leads to an impartial investigation of the data and facts that remains not swayed by irrelevant emotions.</p>
    <p>As part and parcel of logic, critical thinking also teaches us what logical principles we, as rational beings, should follow in right reasoning. It is also important to recall that, in this chapter, characteristics of critical and uncritical persons, criteria for critical thinking, what it means for a good argument, and other related issues were addressed.</p>
