        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">Chapter Overview</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          This chapter focuses on the power of disciplined thinking—learning to think independently and become your own person. While many high schools emphasize "lower-order thinking" (passively absorbing and repeating information), colleges and universities prioritize fostering "higher-order thinking": the active, intelligent evaluation of ideas and information.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">
           As Martin Luther King Jr. stated, “The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically.” Therefore, the primary goal of teaching critical thinking is to equip students with the ability to think—to become independent, self-directed thinkers and learners. It involves personal empowerment and enrichment derived from using one's mind to its full potential. This chapter addresses the meaning, standards, principles, characteristics, barriers, and benefits of critical thinking.

        <!-- Slide 4: What is Critical Thinking? -->
        <div class="slide">
           <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">What is Critical Thinking?</h2>
            <div class="activity-box">
                <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700">Activity # 1:</p>
                <p class="italic text-gray-600">How would you define critical thinking?</p>
            </div>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             The word <strong>critical</strong> implies exercising skilled judgment or observation. In this context, critical thinking means thinking clearly and intelligently. More specifically, <strong>critical thinking</strong> is the general term for a broad set of cognitive skills and intellectual dispositions required to effectively identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments and claims to truth.
           </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
              Furthermore, critical thinking helps individuals discover and overcome personal biases, formulate and present convincing reasons for conclusions, and make reasonable, intelligent decisions about what to believe and how to act.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 5: Defining Critical Thinking -->
        <div class="slide">
           <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Defining Critical Thinking Further</h2>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             However, mere intelligence does not guarantee the ability to think critically or reason effectively about information. Being smart is not sufficient; critical thinking is a process or journey that helps us reach the most useful, well-supported conclusions when evaluating claims.
           </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Critical thinking involves thinking clearly, fairly, rationally, objectively, and independently. It is a process aimed at impartial investigation, unswayed by irrelevant emotions. The ultimate goal is to arrive at well-reasoned, considered, and justifiable conclusions.
           </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
              The American philosopher John Dewey defined critical thinking as an "active, persistent, and careful consideration of a belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds which support it and the further conclusions to which it tends." Key aspects of this definition include the emphasis on being active, persistent, and focusing on the grounds (reasons) supporting beliefs.
            </p>
        </div>

         <!-- Slide 6: Dewey's Definition: Active and Persistent -->
         <div class="slide">
           <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Dewey's Definition: Active and Persistent Consideration</h2>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             First, Dewey emphasizes that critical thinking is an <strong>‘active’</strong> process. This contrasts with passively receiving ideas and information from others. Critical thinking involves actively engaging with information: thinking things through for oneself, raising questions, seeking relevant information, rather than passively learning from external sources.
           </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
              Second, it requires <strong>persistent and careful consideration</strong>. This contrasts with unreflective thinking, such as jumping to conclusions or making hasty decisions. While quick decisions are sometimes necessary or appropriate for minor issues, critical thinking demands persistence and careful thought, especially for important matters.
            </p>
         </div>

          <!-- Slide 7: Dewey's Definition: Grounds and Implications -->
          <div class="slide">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Dewey's Definition: Grounds and Implications</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
              The most crucial part of Dewey’s definition concerns the <strong>‘grounds which support’</strong> a belief and the <strong>‘further conclusions to which it tends’</strong>. In essence, Dewey highlights the importance of *reasons* for holding beliefs and understanding the *implications* of those beliefs. Critical thinking places immense value on reasoning—providing reasons, evaluating reasoning, and understanding logical consequences. While there's more to critical thinking, skillful reasoning is undeniably a core element.
            </p>
          </div>

           <!-- Slide 8: Glaser's Definition -->
           <div class="slide">
             <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Glaser's Definition: Attitude and Skill</h2>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Edward Glaser offered another influential definition, describing critical thinking as involving: (1) an <strong>attitude</strong> of being disposed to thoughtfully consider problems and subjects within one's experience; (2) <strong>knowledge</strong> of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning; and (3) <strong>skill</strong> in applying those methods.
              </p>
             <p class="text-gray-600">
               Glaser's definition, clearly influenced by Dewey, emphasizes two key aspects widely recognized today:
               <br>• Critical thinking involves specific thinking <strong>skills</strong> (like logical analysis).
               <br>• Critical thinking also requires a <strong>disposition</strong> or attitude—a willingness and inclination to use those skills thoughtfully.
               <br>It combines habits of mind and abilities in approaching and understanding experience.
             </p>
           </div>

           <!-- Slide 9: Paul's Definition: Self-Improvement -->
           <div class="slide">
             <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Paul's Definition: Improving Thinking Quality</h2>
             <p class="text-gray-600">
               Richard Paul provides another important perspective: <strong>Critical thinking</strong> is "that mode of thinking—about any subject, content or problem—in which the thinker improves the quality of his or her thinking by skillfully taking charge of the structures inherent in thinking and imposing intellectual standards upon them."
             </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">
                Paul's definition uniquely emphasizes self-reflection and improvement. It highlights a consensus view among scholars: developing critical thinking involves <strong>‘thinking about one’s thinking’</strong> (meta-cognition) and consciously striving to improve it by adhering to standards of good reasoning within a specific domain.
              </p>
           </div>

           <!-- Slide 10: Scriven's Definition & Critico-Creative Thinking -->
           <div class="slide">
             <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Scriven's Definition & Critico-Creative Thinking</h2>
             <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
               Michael Scriven defined critical thinking as the "skilled and active interpretation and evaluation of observations and communications, information and argumentation." He viewed it as a fundamental academic competency, comparable to reading and writing. Scriven stressed that critical thinking is a <strong>‘skilled’</strong> activity; merely intending to think critically isn't enough. Thinking must meet objective standards (like clarity, relevance, reasonableness) to qualify as critical, and proficiency in meeting these standards varies.
             </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">
                Critical thinking is sometimes termed <strong>‘critico-creative’</strong> thinking. This addresses two points:
                <br>1. It counters the misconception that "critical" implies only negative criticism.
                <br>2. It highlights that effective evaluation requires creativity—imagining alternatives, considering different viewpoints, finding additional information, etc.
              </p>
           </div>

            <!-- Slide 11: Critico-Creative Thinking (Continued) -->
            <div class="slide">
              <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Critico-Creative Thinking (Continued)</h2>
              <p class="text-gray-600">
                To effectively judge arguments and ideas, one must not only identify flaws but also envision better alternatives and consider the strongest possible case for different viewpoints. This requires imagination and creativity. Thus, while "critico-creative" emphasizes the positive and imaginative aspects, the widely used term "critical thinking" should be understood in this comprehensive sense: evaluative thinking that involves both critique and creativity, particularly concerning the quality of reasoning supporting beliefs or actions.
              </p>

                <p class="text-gray-600">
                  Critical thinking is disciplined thinking guided by clear intellectual standards. Not all thinking qualifies as critical. To distinguish critical from uncritical thinking, we apply certain standards—conditions or levels that thinking must meet to be considered rigorous and acceptable. Key intellectual standards include clarity, precision, accuracy, relevance, consistency, logical correctness, completeness, and fairness. This section discusses these essential standards.

                 </div>
                 <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">
                   As established, critical thinking involves disciplined evaluation based on clear intellectual standards. These standards serve as benchmarks to differentiate rigorous, critical thought from uncritical thought. They define the conditions necessary for thinking to be considered sound and acceptable.
                 </p>
              </div>

               <!-- Slide 15: Standard 1: Clarity -->

                 <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">1. Clarity</h3>
                 <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                   <strong>Clarity</strong> requires understanding concepts clearly and expressing them in language free from obscurity and vagueness. When constructing or evaluating arguments, clarity is paramount. Before effectively assessing an argument, we must clearly understand what is being asserted. Lack of clarity hinders evaluation.
                 </p>
                  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                    Clarity acts as a "gateway" standard. If a statement is unclear, we cannot determine its accuracy, relevance, or logical merit because its meaning is uncertain. For example, the question "What can be done about the education system in Ethiopia?" is vague. To address it critically, one needs to clarify the specific problem being considered. A clearer formulation might be: "What strategies can educators implement to ensure students develop skills essential for success in their careers and daily lives?"
                  </p>
               </div>

                 <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">The Importance of Clarity</h2>
                 <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                   Lack of clarity can stem from laziness, carelessness, lack of skill, or even a misguided attempt to appear sophisticated or profound.
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                    As William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White noted in *The Elements of Style*, "Muddiness is not merely a disturber of prose, it is also a destroyer of life, of hope..." Miscommunication due to unclear language can have serious consequences.
                 </blockquote>
                  <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">
                    Critical thinkers pursue clarity not only in language but also in thought. Achieving personal goals requires clear understanding of those goals, realistic self-assessment, and clear comprehension of challenges and opportunities. Valuing and seeking clarity of thought is essential for self-understanding and effective action.
                  </p>

                 <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                   <strong>Precision</strong> involves being exact, specific, and sufficiently detailed. Many everyday ideas, though seemingly understood, are actually vague. Careful examination reveals imprecision. Achieving precision requires close attention to detail. While precision is obviously vital in fields like medicine or engineering, it's equally important in everyday critical thinking.
                 </p>
                  <p class="text-gray-600">
                    To navigate the complexities and uncertainties of many real-world problems, critical thinkers insist on precise questions and answers: What *exactly* is the problem? What *exactly* are the alternatives? What *exactly* are the pros and cons of each? Habitually seeking such precision is characteristic of critical thought.
                  </p>

                    <strong>Accuracy</strong> relates to correctness and truthfulness. Critical thinking relies on genuine, correct information. Reasoning based on false or inaccurate information will likely lead to flawed conclusions and distorted views of reality.

                    The "Garbage in, garbage out" principle applies to human thinking: decisions based on false information are likely to be poor ones. Critical thinkers value truth and actively seek accurate, timely information to inform their judgments and decisions as consumers, citizens, parents, and professionals.

                     <strong>Relevance</strong> concerns logical connection. In any discussion or analysis, information considered should directly bear on the issue at hand. Raising irrelevant points is a common tactic to distract from the core argument. Critical thinkers focus on information pertinent to the question being addressed. Ideas or premises are relevant if they provide evidence or have a logical bearing on the conclusion's truth or merit.

                     <strong>Consistency</strong> requires holding beliefs and behaving in ways that are not contradictory. Logic dictates that if beliefs are inconsistent, at least one must be false. Critical thinkers strive for consistency, scrutinizing their own thinking and others' assertions for contradictions.

                     <li>
                       <strong>Logical Inconsistency:</strong> Holding beliefs that cannot simultaneously be true (e.g., believing both that all politicians are corrupt and that Senator Smith is an honest politician).
                     </li>
                     <li>
                       <strong>Practical Inconsistency:</strong> A mismatch between one's stated beliefs or values and one's actions (hypocrisy). While sometimes deliberate, this often stems from self-deception.

                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                      While hypocrisy is a character issue, cases where individuals are unaware of practical inconsistencies highlight the human capacity for self-deception. Critical thinking aims to uncover such hidden inconsistencies.

                   <blockquote class="text-gray-700 italic text-sm">
                     Author Harold Kushner illustrates practical inconsistency: "Ask the average person which is more important... making money or being devoted to his family, and virtually everyone will answer family... But watch how the average person actually lives... See where he really invests his time and energy... he will give away the fact that he really does not live by what he says he believes." People might rationalize long work hours as devotion, masking conflicting priorities.
                   </blockquote>
                   <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">
                     Critical thinking helps reveal unconscious practical inconsistencies, enabling rational resolution. Similarly, people often hold logically inconsistent beliefs without realizing it (e.g., claiming all morality is relative while simultaneously condemning certain actions as objectively wrong). Critical thinking fosters awareness and avoidance of such logical contradictions. Critical thinkers strive for both logical and practical consistency.

                     To think logically means to reason correctly—drawing well-founded conclusions from beliefs or evidence. Critical thinking requires not only accurate beliefs but also the ability to reason validly or strongly from those beliefs. Illogical thinking involves drawing conclusions that don't actually follow from the premises or holding mutually contradictory ideas. Thinking is logical when the combined thoughts are mutually supportive and coherent.

                      Critical thinking values depth and thoroughness over superficiality. While deep analysis isn't always feasible or appropriate (e.g., in a brief editorial), thinking is generally better when it explores issues comprehensively rather than skimming the surface. Completeness involves considering multiple perspectives, relevant factors, and potential complexities.

                     <strong>Fairness</strong> requires thinking that is open-minded, impartial, and free from distorting biases and preconceptions. Achieving complete objectivity is challenging; personal experiences and cultural backgrounds inevitably shape perspectives. People naturally resist unfamiliar ideas, prejudge issues, stereotype others, and equate truth with self-interest or group interest.

                      While perfect freedom from bias might be unattainable, striving for basic fair-mindedness is essential for critical thinking. It involves acknowledging one's own perspective and potential biases, and actively working to consider other viewpoints equitably, especially when evaluating ideas that challenge one's own interests or beliefs.

                            Participants in a discussion should be willing to accept that their own initial views might be incorrect or incomplete. Recognizing one's potential fallibility is crucial for genuine inquiry and open-mindedness.

                        <p class="text-gray-600">
                          Consciously accepting your own fallibility signals a willingness to learn and potentially change your mind if presented with better arguments or evidence. Refusing to acknowledge fallibility suggests a closed-minded approach, hindering productive discussion. Given the complexity of many issues and the diversity of perspectives, it's statistically more likely that any individual is wrong about some things than right about everything. Admitting fallibility opens the door to intellectual growth and finding more defensible positions.

                           Principle: Commit to earnestly searching for the truth or the most defensible position.

                         <p class="text-gray-600">
                           This principle involves a genuine desire to find the best answer, rather than simply defending a pre-existing belief. It requires willingness to seriously examine alternative views, seek insights in others' positions, and allow one's own views to be challenged through arguments and objections.

                            The search for truth is often a collaborative process involving discussion and the critical examination of diverse ideas. A genuine interest in truth necessitates considering alternative perspectives and welcoming critiques of one's own arguments. If the goal is simply to win or confirm existing biases, the pursuit of truth is compromised.

                              <li><strong>The Clarity Principle:</strong> Strive to express your own points clearly and precisely, and seek clarification when others' points are unclear. Avoid vagueness and ambiguity.</li>
                              <li><strong>The Burden of Proof Principle:</strong> Recognize that the responsibility for providing supporting evidence lies with the person making a claim. Do not demand that others disprove your unsupported claims.</li>
                              <li><strong>The Principle of Charity:</strong> When interpreting someone else's argument, formulate it in its strongest, most plausible version, addressing the best possible case for their view, rather than attacking a weak caricature (Straw Man).</li>
                              <li><strong>The Suspension of Judgment Principle:</strong> If the available evidence or reasoning is insufficient to support any conclusion, be willing to withhold judgment until further evidence is available. Avoid jumping to conclusions.</li>
                              <li><strong>The Resolution Principle:</strong> Aim to resolve the issue by accepting the conclusion best supported by the evidence and arguments. Be willing to revise your position if significant new evidence emerges, but avoid reopening the issue without good reason.</li>

                                 Critical thinking involves disciplined skills and attitudes for evaluating arguments and claims. If critical thinking is so valuable, why is uncritical thinking common, even among intelligent individuals? The reasons are complex.

                                 <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                                   <strong>Egocentrism</strong>, the tendency to see reality centered on oneself, is a powerful barrier. Egocentric individuals view their own interests, ideas, and values as inherently superior. While varying in degree, egocentric biases affect nearly everyone.
                                 </p>

                                       <li><strong>Self-Interested Thinking:</strong> Accepting/defending beliefs primarily because they align with one's own interests.</li>
                                       <li><strong>Superiority Bias (Illusory Superiority):</strong> Overrating oneself or seeing oneself as better than average in various respects.</li>

                                  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                                    <strong>Self-interested thinking</strong> involves favoring beliefs that benefit oneself, often regardless of objective evidence. Examples abound: doctors supporting laws limiting malpractice suits, professors favoring tenure and sabbaticals, factory workers supporting plant closing notifications (while owners oppose them). While some positions might have valid reasons, self-interest often influences belief formation.
                                  </p>

                                    This bias obstructs critical thinking. Reasoning that "This benefits me, therefore it is good" relies on the unstated, self-serving assumption that one's own wants and needs are paramount. Critical thinking rejects such special pleading, demanding objective evaluation of evidence and arguments, prioritizing truth even when inconvenient.
                                  </p>

                                     The <strong>superiority bias</strong> (or illusory superiority) is the tendency to overestimate one's own qualities and abilities relative to others. Most people tend to see themselves as above average in positive traits (like intelligence, fairness, or driving skill) and less susceptible to biases than others—a statistically unlikely scenario. Believing oneself immune to such self-deception is itself an indicator of superiority bias. Recognizing this universal tendency is a step towards mitigating egocentric thought.

                                      <strong>Sociocentrism</strong>, or group-centered thinking, is another major barrier. It involves focusing excessively on one's group identity and interests, hindering rational thought. Like egocentrism for the individual, sociocentrism prioritizes the group perspective.

                                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                                      <strong>Group bias</strong> is often absorbed unconsciously from childhood, leading people to assume the superiority of their own society's beliefs, institutions, and values. This "mine-is-better" thinking contributes significantly to conflict, intolerance, and oppression globally.

                                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                                      <strong>Conformism</strong> stems from the powerful human motivation to belong. This desire can override individual critical judgment, leading people to adopt group beliefs or follow authority figures without independent evaluation. Classic social psychology experiments (like Milgram's obedience studies or Asch's conformity experiments) demonstrate how easily individuals can abandon their own judgment under group or authority pressure.

                                       The influence of authority and the pressure to conform can significantly impair critical thinking. We can be easily impressed or intimidated into abandoning our own values and judgments. As critical thinkers, recognizing the seductive power of peer pressure and undue reliance on authority is essential. Cultivating habits of independent thought and questioning group assumptions are necessary countermeasures.

                                       An <strong>assumption</strong> is something taken for granted as true without proof. Many daily actions rely on warranted assumptions based on past experience (e.g., assuming class will be held at the scheduled time). These are reasonable expectations.

                                       However, <strong>unwarranted assumptions</strong>—those held without good reason—are significant barriers to critical thinking. They distort perception and reasoning.

                                        A common type of unwarranted assumption is a <strong>stereotype</strong>: a generalized belief about a group of people, assuming all members share certain characteristics, often ignoring individual differences.

                                        Stereotyping involves forming opinions about individuals based on group membership rather than individual qualities. It assumes uniformity ("all politicians are alike," "all members of X group are Y"). Since individuals within any group vary significantly, stereotypes are frequently false, oversimplified, or misleading generalizations.

                                        Stereotypes often arise from <strong>hasty generalization</strong>—drawing broad conclusions from insufficient evidence (e.g., judging an entire nationality based on encountering one individual). Media portrayals and social biases can also perpetuate stereotypes. Recognizing and challenging our tendency to stereotype is crucial for fair and accurate thinking.

                                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                                          Cultural moral relativism often seems appealing for two main reasons:
                                          <br>1. It appears to explain persistent, deep disagreements in ethics by suggesting there's no objective truth, only differing opinions.
                                          <br>2. It seems to promote tolerance by implying we shouldn't judge other cultures' practices by our own standards.
                                        </p>
                                         <p class="text-gray-600">
                                           However, these appeals face significant problems. First, disagreement about an issue (like ethics or religion) doesn't logically entail that there is no objective truth concerning that issue. Difficulty in finding truth doesn't mean truth doesn't exist.
                                         </p>

                                          Second, cultural moral relativism doesn't consistently support tolerance. It dictates adherence to one's own culture's norms. If a culture *values* intolerance, then relativism would imply that being intolerant is morally right for members of that culture.
                                        </p>
                                         <p class="text-gray-600">
                                           Furthermore, cultural relativism makes meaningful moral criticism of other cultures (or even one's own culture's past or present norms) impossible, as it implies that the prevailing cultural standard *is* the ultimate moral standard for that culture. It also struggles with defining "culture" and handling subcultures or individuals who disagree with the majority.

                                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                                          While flawed as a theory of truth, the prevalence of moral disagreement highlighted by relativism *should* encourage intellectual humility. Recognizing that decent, intelligent people hold vastly different moral views should make us cautious about assuming the absolute correctness of our own beliefs.
                                        </p>
                                         <p class="text-gray-600">
                                           This lesson in open-mindedness and caution doesn't require accepting the problematic tenets of relativism itself. It can be learned through critical thinking and empathetic engagement with diverse perspectives. Relativism, ultimately, undermines the very possibility of critical evaluation by suggesting all opinions (individual or cultural) are equally valid.

                                          <strong>Wishful thinking</strong> occurs when we believe something not because of good evidence, but simply because we *want* it to be true. It involves letting desires dictate beliefs.

                                           This is a common human tendency. People often fear the unknown, death, or powerlessness, leading them to embrace comforting myths, unsubstantiated cures, or beliefs in extraordinary phenomena (like psychic powers) without critical scrutiny, simply because these beliefs fulfill a desire or alleviate a fear. Reason often struggles against the allure of wishful thinking. Critical thinking requires confronting reality as it is, based on evidence, rather than shaping beliefs according to desires.

                                              University assignments often require constructing your own arguments (e.g., writing argumentative essays). Success demands more than just assessing information; it requires organizing evidence and reasoning to convincingly support your thesis. Critical thinking training systematically improves this crucial skill.

                                              Crucially, critical thinking skills are <strong>transferable</strong>. Learning how to structure arguments, judge source credibility, or make reasoned decisions in one context equips you to apply these skills across diverse subjects, professional situations, and personal life challenges. The goal is to facilitate this transfer, making critical thinking a universally applicable tool.

Informed, rational decision-making by the populace is vital. Critical thinking equips citizens to evaluate policies, assess candidates, and participate constructively. Addressing complex societal problems (e.g., environmental issues, poverty, conflict) requires widespread critical thought.

Historically, people often accepted prevailing beliefs without question (e.g., geocentrism, divine right of kings, social inequalities). Critical thinking empowers individuals to question assumptions, challenge biases inherited from their upbringing or society, and step back from dominant ideologies.

This intellectual liberation—the ability to think for oneself—is arguably the ultimate goal and highest reward of education.

It encompasses a range of cognitive skills and intellectual dispositions necessary for effectively identifying, analyzing, and evaluating arguments and truth claims. It helps overcome biases, present reasoned conclusions, and make intelligent decisions about beliefs and actions.

                                                Intelligence alone does not guarantee critical thinking, which is an active process aimed at reaching well-reasoned, justifiable conclusions through clear, fair, rational, objective, and independent thought. It requires adhering to intellectual standards (clarity, precision, accuracy, relevance, consistency, logical correctness, completeness, fairness) and following principles of good argumentation and intellectual conduct (fallibility, truth-seeking, clarity, burden of proof, charity, suspension of judgment, resolution).

Common barriers include egocentrism, sociocentrism, unwarranted assumptions, stereotypes, relativism, and wishful thinking. Overcoming these barriers through critical thinking yields significant benefits in academic performance, personal decision-making, civic engagement, and intellectual autonomy.
