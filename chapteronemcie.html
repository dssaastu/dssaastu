        <p class="italic text-gray-600 mb-4">What does civic education mean?</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Since human being is a social animal and couldn't live alone, he/she has to respect certain fundamental principles and values to live together with his/her fellow beings and consequently build peaceful society and lead prosperous life. As Johan Stuart Mill (1972) described it, progressive and peaceful setting subsists in a given society as far as that society develops the qualities of its members and generates good citizens. Aristotle (1955) also added that citizens of a State should always be educated to suit the constitution of a State. Accordingly, creating a good citizen has been the prior concern of many States, including Ethiopia. This is because good citizens are made not born.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Over the years, different terms have been used in an attempt to capture and describe the educational experiences that deal with the task of developing democratic minded citizens. The subject assumed different names and purposes depending on countries' ideologies and thus the definition of the discipline vary across States. Terms such as Right Education (in South Africa), Citizenship Education (in United States of America and Germany), Citizenship and Character Education (in Singapore), Civics and Ethical Education (in Ethiopia) are just a few examples that can be found in the literature.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">1.3.1 Civic Education (Continued)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Though the most cited definition of civic education is an education that studies about the rights and responsibilities of citizens of a politically organized group of people, different writers define it in many ways. For instance, Patrick (1986) defines civic education as the knowledge of the constitutions, the principles, values, history and application to contemporary life. Citizenship education can be understood as the knowledge, means, and activities designed to encourage students to participate actively in democratic life, accepting and exercising their rights and responsibilities. United Nations Development Program (UNDP, 2004) defines civic education as a way of learning for effective participation in a democratic and development process. On his part, Aggarwal (1982) linked civic education to the development of ideas, habits, behaviors and useful attitudes in the individual which enables him to be a useful member of the society. Still the subject matter can be also defined as the process of helping young people acquire and learn to use the skills, knowledge, and attitudes that will prepare them to be competent and responsible citizens throughout their lives.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Actually, these different concepts and meanings were used to differentiate between a maximal and a minimal civic education. The minimal concept of civic education is content-led, teacher-based, whole-class teaching and examination-based assessment. However, the maximal concept of civic education is comprised of knowledge, values and skills, and aims to prepare students for active, responsible participation. Unlike narrow minimalist civic education, it extends learning beyond the curriculum and classroom to all activities inside and outside school. In addition, it is highly dependent on interactive teaching, which requires discussion, debate and the creation of many opportunities for students to participate effectively.

      <!-- Slide 5: Defining Ethics -->
      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">1.3.2 The Definition and Nature of Ethics (A)</h2>
        <p class="font-semibold mt-4 text-gray-700">Dear Students:</p>
        <p class="italic text-gray-600 mb-4">What do we mean by the term ‘ethics'? Before you read on, take a few moments to write down a definition of what you think the term means.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Ethics is a branch of philosophy that attempts to understand people's moral beliefs and actions (these modules use the terms, ‘ethics' and 'morality'; 'ethical' and 'moral' interchangeably, although traditionally ‘ethics' described the process of thinking about people's morality). Ethics, or moral philosophy, considers theories about what human beings are capable of doing, alongside accounts of what they <em>ought to do</em> if they are to live an ethically good life. Ethics also explores the meaning and the ranking of different ethical values, such as honesty, autonomy, equality and justice, and it considers ethical quandaries that human beings face in the course of living their own independent but, also, socially interdependent lives.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Ethics, or moral philosophy: considers theories about what human beings are capable of doing, alongside accounts of what they ought to do if they are to live an ethically good life. Ethics may share common ground with the law, religious belief, popular opinion, professional codes and the dictates of authority figures, but it is also broader than all of these and offers a set of tools and values against which their appropriateness can be evaluated.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Invariably all ethical questions involve a decision about what one <em>should do</em> in a specific instance. Notice the word <em>should</em>. Ethical questions are not concerned with what one would do (an essentially psychological concern) but what one <em>ought to do</em>. Judgments about such decisions are generally expressed with words like right and wrong, should and ought, or obligation and duty.
         </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Slide 6: Defining Ethics (Continued) -->
      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">1.3.2 Defining Ethics (A - Continued)</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Occasionally the term ethics is used interchangeably with morals. Business or medical ethics, for example, is generally synonymous with morals. Although this is acceptable, a precise usage would apply the term's morals and moral to the conduct itself, while the terms ethics and ethical would refer to the study of moral conduct or to the code that one follows. Thus, the specific act of telling the caller you were home could be described as moral or immoral. But what makes any act moral or immoral, right or wrong fall within the province of ethics.
         </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           When we speak of moral problems then, we generally refer to specific problems, such as "Is lying ever right?" or "Is stealing always wrong?" in contrast, we can look at ethical problems as being more general and theoretical. Thus, “what makes any act, such as lying or stealing, right or wrong?" and “what makes any entity good?” are ethical problems.
           <strong>In short, morality refers to the degree to which an action conforms to a standard or norm of human conduct. Ethics refers to the philosophical study of values and of what constitute good and bad human conduct.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           In dealing with human conduct from the perspective of obligation and value, ethics investigates a variety of related concerns. Among them are whether a standard of morality exists that applies to all people at all times everywhere, the precise nature of moral responsibility, the conditions under which one is morally accountable or responsible, and the proper end of law. When ethicists use word like “good” or “right” to describe a person or action they generally means that the person or action conforms to some standard. A good person or action has certain desirable qualities.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Ethicists often disagree about the nature of those standards and desirable qualities and follow different paths in establishing standards and discovering which qualities are desirable. For purposes of understanding, though, we can view ethics as divided into two fields; normative ethics and non-normative ethics.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2">Generally, Ethics is:</p>
        <ul class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 mb-4">
           <li>The critical examination and evaluation of what is good, evil, right and wrong in human conduct (Guy, 2001).</li>
           <li>A specific set of principles, values and guidelines for a particular group or organization (Guy, 2001).</li>
           <li>Ethics is the study of goodness, right action and moral responsibility, it asks what choices and ends we ought to pursue and what moral principles should govern our pursuits and choices (Madden, 2000).</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Slide 7: Defining Morality -->
      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">1.3.2 Defining Morality (B)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Of course, morality is a complex concept. Though it is one of most frequently used terms, it can mean different things to different people. Morality is a commonly used word in most cultures. Some Scholars argued that if we do not know what morality is we cannot teach it. In crucial ways we do not know what morality is. Yet we must teach it because it is of prime importance and must be learned. Moreover, teaching must not be brainwashing; it must be moral. So, in order to understand Moral and Civics Education, the term "moral" needs to be understood.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Morality can be viewed from different perspectives and let us start with the simple definition of the word itself. Morality from a dictionary definition (from Latin <em>moralitas</em> “manner, character, proper behavior") refers to the concept of human action which pertains to matters of right and wrong – also referred to as “good and evil”.
           <strong>It can be used to mean the generally accepted code of conduct in a society, or within a subgroup of society.</strong>
           It relates to values expressed as: a matter of individual choice, those values to which we ought to aspire and those values shared within a culture, religious, secular, or philosophical community. This definition is clear when morality is spelt out and agreed upon by others. However, it becomes ambiguous when defined by different ethnic groups, especially in the multicultural society, like Ethiopians.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Morality has been a topic of discussion for a very long time. According to Socrates "We are discussing no small matter, but how we ought to live” when issues of morality are discussed.
        </p>

            <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700">Class Activity:</p>
            <p class="italic text-gray-600">Dear Student, Don't you agree with Socrates? What is your view?</p>
        </div>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Socrates is rightly asserted that morality is not a small matter. In fact, moral philosophy is the attempt to achieve a systematic understanding of the nature of morality and what it requires of us. In Socrates' words it's “how we ought to live”. Living in a multicultural Ethiopia, how we ought to live can be very complicated because of the diversity of culture that is vast and unique.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by reason that is, to do what there are the best reasons for doing while giving equal weight to the interest of each individual who will be affected by one's conduct. It is important that in a countries like Ethiopia, morality is shared as a common goal to ensure harmony and integrity.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Terms such as morality and ethics are often used interchangeably in everyday speech as referring to justified or proper conduct.
           <strong>But ethics is usually associated with a certain conduct within a profession, for example, the code of ethics for the teaching profession. Morality is a more general term referring to the character of individuals and community.</strong>
           In other words, Morality is used to refer to what we would call moral conduct while ethics is used to refer to the formal study of moral conduct. It can be claimed that morality is related to praxis, but ethics is related to theory.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-2">Morality is:</p>
        <ul class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 mb-4">
           <li>Those principles and values that actually guide, for better or worse, an individual's personal conduct (Guy, 2001)</li>
           <li>Morality is the informal system of rational beings by which they govern their behavior in order to lesson harm or evil and do good, this system, although informal, enjoys amazing agreement across time and cultures concerning moral rules, moral ideas and moral virtues (Madden, 2000)</li>
        </ul>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Morality, whatever else may be said about it, is about things over which we have control that lead to "bettering human life". It is different in every society, and is a convenient term for socially approved habits.

      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">1.4 Ethics and Law</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          As against morals and ethics, laws are norms, formally approved by state, power or national or international political bodies. Many laws are instituted in order to promote well-being, resolve conflicts of interest, and promote social harmony. However, there are several reasons why ethics is not law.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-4">
           <li>First, <strong>some actions that are illegal may not be unethical</strong>. Speeding is illegal, but one might have an ethical obligation to break the speed limit in order to transport someone to a hospital in an emergency.</li>
           <li>Second, <strong>some actions that are unethical may not be illegal</strong>. Most people would agree that lying is unethical but lying is only illegal under certain conditions, e.g. lying on an income tax return, lying when giving sworn testimony, etc.</li>
           <li>Third, <strong>laws can be unethical or immoral</strong>. The United States had laws permitting slavery in the 1800s but most people today would say that those laws were unethical or immoral. Although we have moral and ethical obligations to obey the law, civil disobedience can be justified when immoral or unethical laws exist.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Since we can appeal to morality and ethics to justify or criticize laws, many writers maintain that the main function of a legal system is to enforce a society's moral and ethical consensus.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Fourth, we use different kinds of mechanisms to express, teach, inculcate, and enforce laws and ethics. Laws are expressed publicly in statutes, penal codes, court rulings, government regulations, and so forth. Although ethics and morals are sometimes made explicit in religious texts, professional codes of conduct, or philosophical writings, many ethical and moral standards are implicit.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Finally, we use the coercive power of government to enforce laws. People who break certain laws can be fined, imprisoned, or executed. People who violate ethical or moral standards do not face these kinds of punishments unless their actions also violate laws. Often we "punish” people who disobey moral or ethical obligations by simply expressing our disapproval or by condemning the behavior.

         <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">1.5 The Importance/Goal of Moral and Civic Education</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Civic education is a discipline that deals with virtue traits rooted in values of respect and culture of tolerance to make individuals responsible and efficient member of their community. It teaches the values and sense of commitment that define an active and principled citizen, how to make responsible decisions, solve problems, care about others, contribute to society, and be tolerant and respectful of diversity.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           <strong>In higher educational institutions of Ethiopia, civics and ethics/moral education is given with the aim of educating students about democratic culture, ethical values and principles, supremacy of constitution, the rule of law, rights and duties of citizens.</strong> These elements are imperative in the process of producing self-confident citizens who decides on issues based on reason. It is also aimed at creating a generation who has the capability to shoulder family and national responsibility. Ethics has also become important in education, because education is a fundamental process of human life. Therefore, ethics is very important subject in education. We can easily reach all knowledge by technology. In education using technology reveals some ethical problems such as plagiarism. In order to understand the importance of ethics, ethics should be placed as a course in educational system.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Generally, the necessity of delivering the course emanates from several needs:

       <!-- Slide 11: Goal 1: Rights and Duties -->
       <div class="slide">
         <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">1.5 Goal 1: Instill Understanding of Rights and Duties</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           The two phrases rights and duties co-exist with each other (they are termed as the two sides of the same coin) that regulate the values and behavioral patterns of an individual. For instance, the State has the obligation to provide health care services because citizens have the right to access that service. However, the State will be unable to ensure that citizens led a healthy life unless citizens themselves act responsibly with respect to their own health (healthy diet, exercise, etc.). Similarly, the state will be unable to meet the needs of children, the elderly or the disabled, if citizens do not agree to share this responsibility; the state cannot protect the environment if citizens are unwilling to reduce, reuse, and recycle; and attempts to create a fairer society will flounder if citizens are chronically intolerant and lack a sense of justice (Rawls, 1971).
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           In short, we need a fuller, richer and yet more subtle understanding and practice of citizenship, because what the ideal society needs cannot be secured by coercion, but only through its members (citizens) who have a balanced understanding of rights and duties.

         </div>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Sastry et al. (2011) presented four issues on the interplay between rights and duties:
           <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
               <li>One's right implies the other's duty (e.g., right to movement implies duty not to interfere).</li>
               <li>One's right implies one's duty to recognize similar rights of others (rights have restrictions).</li>
               <li>One should exercise rights for the promotion of social good (misuse can lead to legal action).</li>
               <li>The State has duties to citizens, and citizens have a duty to support the State's legal endeavors.</li>
           </ol>
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">For this reason, civics and ethics course provides citizens the tools to become informed, think effectively, and act responsibly.</p>

         <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">1.5 Goal 2: Foster Participant Political Culture</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           According to the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences (1961), political culture is the set of attitudes, beliefs, and sentiments which give order and meaning to a political process and provide the underlying assumptions and rules governing behavior. Taylor (1999) describes it as the norms of conduct and the expectations/understandings of rights and responsibilities. Political culture shapes expectations, perceived possibilities for action, and perceived roles.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-2 font-semibold">Almond and Verba (1963) identified three political cultures:</p>
         <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Parochial cultures:</strong> Low cognitive, affective, evaluative orientation towards political system; focus on local/family concerns.</li>
            <li><strong>Subject cultures:</strong> High orientation towards system/outputs, but minimal orientation towards input/participation; passive relationship. Compatible with authoritarian structures.</li>
            <li><strong>Participant cultures:</strong> High orientation towards system, inputs, outputs, and self as active participant. Most compatible with democratic structures.</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           <strong>Democracy can only thrive when citizens understand and participate actively in civic and political life</strong> from the perspective that participation is important, but informed and educated participation is more important.
         </p>
       </div>

      <!-- Slide 13: Political Culture (Continued) & Discussion -->
      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">1.5 Goal 2: Participant Political Culture (Cont.)</h2>
        <div class="bg-blue-50 p-3 rounded border border-blue-200 mb-4">
           <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700">Discussion Question:</p>
           <p class="italic text-gray-600">Which political/civic culture best describes the Ethiopian political situations?</p>
         </div>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            However, many factors challenge democracy, including in Ethiopia. Individual interests can dominate. Many citizens may lack competence/knowledge to navigate tensions between individual/social norms. Support for active citizenship can be low, with many relying only on voting. The self-understanding as recipients/consumers rather than active citizens is also a challenge.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            That's why people in a democratic country need:
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-600 space-y-1">
                <li>In-depth understanding of democratic behavior.</li>
                <li>Sense of identity and ability to tolerate/work with diverse others.</li>
                <li>Desire to participate for the public good and hold authorities accountable.</li>
                <li>Willingness to show self-restraint and exercise personal responsibility.</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">Without citizens possessing these qualities, democracies become difficult to govern, even unstable. Civics and ethics aims to inculcate these competencies.</p>
      </div>

       <!-- Slide 14: Goal 3: Relevant Knowledge, Skills, Attitudes -->
       <div class="slide">
         <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">1.5 Goal 3: Develop Relevant Knowledge, Skills, and Positive Attitudes</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Relevant knowledge is useful for dealing with problems, but it remains inert unless functional (put into practice). Knowledge is also infirm without the right attitudes and requisite skills for societal roles.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            A State needs citizens who are skillful and demonstrate positive attitudes. Right attitudes ensure harmony and peaceful co-existence. Skillful manpower is a prerequisite for development, but without positive attitudes, vices like corruption, bribery, abuse of power, lateness, and absenteeism emerge, leading to counter-production.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            For this reason, civics and ethics is seen as a potential cure for 'social ills' often associated with young people, such as anti-social behavior and political <strong>apathy</strong> (the 'youth deficit' described by Osler and Starkey, 2006). At the local level, social and environmental problems are best resolved through understanding what it means to be a citizen.
         </p>
          <div class="bg-blue-50 p-3 rounded border border-blue-200 mb-4">
           <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700">Group Discussion:</p>
           <p class="italic text-gray-600">What would happen in a State if its citizens lack relevant knowledge, skills and positive attitude?</p>
         </div>
       </div>

      <!-- Slide 15: Goal 4 & 5: Interculturalism, Inclusiveness, Peace-building -->
       <div class="slide">
         <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">1.5 Goals 4 & 5: Interculturalism, Inclusiveness, Peace-building</h2>
         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">4) Fostering intercultural societies:</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Beyond recognizing cultural diversity (multiculturalism), civics and ethics can promote inter-culturalism, which emphasizes relationship, dialogue, reciprocity, and interdependence. It aims to nurture dynamic exchanges based on interaction, openness, and solidarity, helping overcome discrimination and fostering genuine dialogue.
         </p>
         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">The issue of inclusiveness:</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Traditional citizenship concepts often neglected gendered relations and the private sphere. Civics and ethics should nurture new, inclusive relations in both public and private spaces, recognizing differences while ensuring equity. This goes beyond quotas or empowering women to play 'male politics,' promoting democracy and inclusiveness in families, workplaces, unions, etc.
          </p>
         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">5) The issue of peace-building:</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           In a world with militarization, terrorism, civil wars, and genocide, citizenship education must promote cooperation, dialogue, and sustainable peace based on justice. While civics and ethics alone cannot bring peace, it can contribute by developing competencies for peacemaking, conflict resolution, healing, reconstruction, and understanding nonviolent civil disobedience. It fosters values, attitudes, and skills for peace within individuals, relationships, communities, and the world.
         </p>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 16: Core Values & Active Citizenship -->
       <div class="slide">
         <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">1.5 Goals (Continued): Core Values & Active Citizenship</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           The aim of moral/ethical and civic education is to enable people to make decisions by their free will. Teaching norms is easy; teaching the ethics to obey them is harder but essential. Education isn't just about professional knowledge. As Aristotle said, <em class="text-gray-700">"Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all."</em>
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-2 font-semibold">Moral and Civics Education promotes core values such as:</p>
         <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1 mb-4">
           <li>Respect for life</li>
           <li>Respect for reasoning</li>
           <li>Fairness</li>
           <li>Concern for the welfare of others</li>
           <li>Respect for diversity</li>
           <li>Peaceful resolution of conflict</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           In sum, the goal is to produce competent, high moral standard citizens who use their rights and fulfill obligations according to law.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Democracy requires citizen participation ('active citizenship'). This depends on resources, motivations, and social contacts. Citizens need specific competences: "a combination of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values" to "become an active citizen" (Hoskins et al., 2011).
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Recent efforts aim to revitalize citizenship education beyond just 'civics' towards 'democratic citizenship education' and 'education of, for and through democracy' (Lange, 2013).
          </p>

       <!-- Slide 17: Chapter Summary -->
       <div class="slide">
         <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Chapter Summary</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Civic education studies the rights and responsibilities of citizens. Ethics, a branch of philosophy, is the study of morality (rightness/wrongness of actions). Morality involves personal/social values, rules, beliefs, etc., governing conduct.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           In Ethiopia, civics and ethics aims to educate students on democratic culture, ethical values, constitutional supremacy, rule of law, and rights/duties. The major goal is producing good citizens: law-abiding, respectful of authority, contributing to society, patriotic, ethical, defending rights, and serving others. It also aims to create a generation capable of shouldering family and national responsibility.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           The normative value of ethics explores our human origin. It considers Socrates' idea that <em class="text-gray-700">'the unexamined life is not worth living.'</em> Without self-critique, ethical questioning, practical engagement, and understanding tradition, youth remain fragile. Exposure to life's experiences, though risky, helps students become authentic. This involves confronting one's identity and life's contradictions.
         </p>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 18: Chapter Summary (Continued) -->
       <div class="slide">
         <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Chapter Summary (Continued)</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           A new vision for education requires a shift from just reading/writing to skills acquisition relevant to daily life and society. Ethics education offers a new value orientation, training teachers and students, developing technologies, and enabling a new vision, policy, market, resources, and system.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           The normative value of this education is the emergence of a new humanity: responsible leaders driven by values and virtues, knowledgeable enough to transform their environment and serve humanity in a society yearning for ethical and fair-minded leaders.
