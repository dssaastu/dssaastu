        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">Chapter Overview</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Logic</strong>, as field of study, may be defined as the organized body of knowledge, or science that evaluates arguments. The aim of logic is to develop a system of methods and principles that we may use as criteria for evaluating the arguments of others and as guides in constructing arguments of our own.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Argument is a systematic combination of two or more statements, which are classified as a premise or premises and conclusion. A premise refers to the statement, which is claimed to provide a logical support or evidence to the main point of the argument, which is known as conclusion. A conclusion is a statement, which is claimed to follow from the alleged evidence.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">
           Depending on the logical and real ability of the premise(s) to support the conclusion, an argument can be either a good argument or a bad argument. However, unlike all kinds of passages, including those that resemble arguments, all arguments purport to prove something.
         </p>

       <div class="slide">
         <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Chapter Overview (Continued)</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Arguments can generally be divided into deductive and inductive arguments. A deductive argument is an argument in which the premises are claimed to support the conclusion in such a way that it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. On the other hand, an inductive argument is an argument in which the premises are claimed to support the conclusion in such a way that it is improbable that the premises be true and the conclusion false.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             The deductiveness or inductiveness of an argument can be determined by the particular indicator word it might use, the actual strength of the inferential relationship between its component statements, and its argumentative form or structure.
           </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
             A deductive argument can be evaluated by its validity and soundness. Likewise, an inductive argument can be evaluated by its strength and cogency. Depending on its actually ability to successfully maintain its inferential claim, a deductive argument can be either valid or invalid. That is, if the premise(s) of a certain deductive argument actually support its conclusion in such a way that it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false, then that particular deductive argument is valid. If, however, its premise(s) actually support its conclusion in such a way that it is possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false, then that particular deductive argument is invalid. Similarly, an inductive argument can be either strong or weak, depending on its actually ability to successfully maintain its inferential claim. That is, if the premise(s) of a certain inductive argument actually support its conclusion in such a way that it is improbable for the premises to be true and the conclusion false, then that particular inductive argument is strong. If, however, its premise(s) actually support its conclusion in such a way that it is probable for the premises to be true and the conclusion false, then that particular inductive argument is weak.

             <p class="text-gray-600">
               Furthermore, depending on its actually ability to successfully maintain its inferential claim as well as its factual claim, a deductive argument can be either sound or unsound. That is, if a deductive argument actually maintained its inferential claim, (i.e., if it is valid), and its factual claim, (i.e., if all of its premises are true), then that particular deductive argument will be a sound argument. However, if it fails to maintain either of its claims, it will be an unsound argument. Likewise, depending on its actually ability to successfully maintain its inferential claim as well as its factual claim, an inductive argument can be either cogent or uncogent. That is, if an inductive argument actually maintained its inferential claim, (i.e., if it is strong), and its factual claim, (i.e., if all of its premises are probably true), then that particular inductive argument will be a cogent argument. However, if it fails to maintain either of its claims, it will be an uncogent argument. In this chapter, we will discuss logic and its basic concepts, the techniques of distinguishing arguments from non-argumentative passages, and the types of arguments.

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Logic is generally be defined as a philosophical science that evaluates arguments. An argument is a systematic combination of one or more than one statements, which are claimed to provide a logical support or evidence (i.e., premise(s) to another single statement which is claimed to follow logically from the alleged evidence (i.e., conclusion). An argument can be either good or bad argument, depending on the logical ability of its premise(s) to support its conclusion.

           The primary aim of logic is to develop a system of methods and principles that we may use as criteria for evaluating the arguments of others and as guides in constructing arguments of our own. The study of logic increases students’ confidence to criticize the arguments of others and advance arguments of their own. In this , we will discuss the meaning and basic concepts of logic: arguments, premises, and conclusions.

           </div>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Dear learners, the word logic comes from Greek word <em>logos</em>, which means sentence, discourse, reason, truth and rule. Logic in its broader meaning is the science, which evaluates arguments and the study of correct reasoning. It could be also defined as the study of methods and principles of correct reasoning or the art of correct reasoning.

        <div class="slide">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Definitions & Benefits of Studying Logic</h2>
             <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Logic can be defined in different ways. Here below are some definitions of logic:</p>
             <ul class="arrow-list pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1">
               <li>Logic is a science that evaluates arguments.</li>
               <li>Logic is the study of methods for evaluating arguments. More precisely, logic is the study of methods for evaluating whether the premises of arguments adequately support or provide a good evidence for the conclusions.</li>
               <li>Logic is a science that helps to develop the method and principles that we may use as a criterion for evaluating the arguments of others and as a guide to construct good arguments of our own.</li>
               <li>Logic is the attempt to codify the rules of rational thought. Logicians explore the structure of arguments that preserve truth or allow the optimal extraction of knowledge from evidence.</li>
               <li>Logic is one of the primary tools philosophers use in their inquiries. The precision of logic helps them to cope with the subtlety of philosophical problems and the often misleading nature of conversational language.</li>
             </ul>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">
                In logic, as an academic discipline, we study reasoning itself: forms of argument, general principles and particular errors, along with methods of arguing. We see lots of mistakes in reasoning in daily life and logic can help us understand what is wrong or why someone is arguing in a particular way.

           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             We use logic in our day-to-day communications. As human beings, we all think, reason and argue; and we all are subject to the reasoning of other people. Some of us may think well, reason well and argue well, but some of us may not. The ability to think, reason and argue well might partially be a matter of natural gift. However, whatever our natural gifts, they can be refined, improved and sharpened; and the study of logic is one of the best ways to refine one’s natural ability to think, reason and argue.
           </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
             Likewise, as academicians, our arguments must be logical and acceptable; and the tool to do so is provided by logic. In general, the following are some of the major benefits that we can gain from the study of logic:

              The aim of logic, hence, is to develop the system of methods and principles that we may use as criteria for evaluating the arguments of others and as guides in constructing the arguments of our own in our day-to-day lives. Thus, by studying logic, we are able to increase our confidence when we criticize the arguments of others and when we advance arguments of our own. In fact, one of the goals of logic is to produce individuals who are critical, rational and reasonable both in the sphere of public and private life. However, to be full beneficial of the worth which logic provides, one must thoroughly and carefully understand the basic concepts of the subject and be able to apply them in the actual situations.

             <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
               Dear learners, the word ‘argument’ may not be a new word to all of us. For all of us encounter arguments in our day-to-day experience. We read them in books and newspapers, hear them on television, and formulate them when communicating with friends and associates. If you look back at the above different definitions of logic and characterizations, you will certainly find one thing in common: argument. Moreover, we have said that of the various benefits of studying logic, identifying, analyzing and evaluating arguments is the most important one. It follows that argument the primary subject matter of logic.
             </p>
             <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
               What is an argument then? <strong>Argument</strong> is a technical term and the chief concern of logic. Argument might have defined and described in different ways. When we define an arguments from logical point of view, it is a group of statements, one or more of which (the premise) are claimed to provide support for, or reason to believe, one of the other, the (conclusion). As is apparent from the above definition, the term “argument” has a very specific meaning in logic. It does not mean, for example, a mere verbal fight, as one might have with one’s parent, spouse, or friend. Let us examine the features of this definition in detail.
             </p>
         </div>

         <!-- Slide 13: Argument - Group of Statements -->
         <div class="slide">
           <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Argument is a Group of Statements</h2>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             First, an argument is a group of statements. That is, the first requirement for a passage to be qualified as an argument is to combine two or more statements.
           </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">But, what is a statement?</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              A <strong>statement</strong> is a declarative sentence that has a truth-value of either true or false. That is, statement is a sentence that has truth-value. Hence, truth and falsity are the two possible truth-values of a statement. A statement is typically a declarative sentence. In other words, statement is a type of sentence that could stand as a declarative sentence.
            </p>
             <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Look the following examples:</p>
             <ol class="list-[lower-alpha] pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1">
               <li>Dr. Abiy Ahmed the current Prime Minister of Ethiopia.</li>
               <li>Mekelle is the capital city of Tigray Region.</li>
               <li>Ethiopia was colonized by Germany.</li>
             </ol>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Statement (a) and (b) are true, because they describe things as they are, or assert what really is the case. Hence, ‘Truth’ is their truth-value. Whereas statement (c) is false because it asserts what is not, and ‘Falsity’ its truth-value.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600 note-box">
                <strong>N.B:</strong> Logicians used proposition and statement interchangeably. However, in strict (technical) sense, proposition is the meaning or information content of a statement. In this chapter, the term statement is used to refer premises and a conclusion.
              </p>

             <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
               However, there are sentences that are not statements, and hence should not be used to construct an argument. Examples:

                 In fact, sentence is a group of words or phrases that enables us to express ideas or thought meaningfully. However, unlike statements, none of the above sentences can be either true or false. Hence, none of them can be classified as statement. As a result, none of them can make up an argument.

               Second, the statements that make up an argument are divided into premise(s) and conclusion. That means, the mere fact that a passage contains two or more statements cannot guarantee the existence of an argument. Hence, an argument is a group statement, which contains at least one premise and one and only one conclusion. This definition makes it clear that an argument may contain more than one premise but only one conclusion.

               Argument always attempts to justify a claim. The claim that the statement attempts to justify is known as a <strong>conclusion</strong> of an argument; and the statement or statements that supposedly justify the claim is/are known as the <strong>premises</strong> of the argument. Therefore, a <strong>premise</strong> is a statement that set forth the reason or evidence, which is given for accepting the conclusion of an argument. It is claimed evidence; and a <strong>conclusion</strong> is a statement, which is claimed to follow from the given evidence (premise). In other words, the conclusion is the claim that an argument is trying to establish.

                 In both arguments, the first two statements are premises, because they are claimed to provide evidence for the third statement, whereas the third statement is a conclusion because it is claimed to follow from the given evidences.

The former are said to be good (well-supported) arguments, the latter bad (poorly-supported) arguments. For example, compare the above two examples. In the first argument, the premises really do support the conclusion, they give good reason for believing that the conclusion is true, and therefore, the argument is a good one. But the premises of the second argument fail to support the conclusion adequately. Even if they may be true, they do not provide good reason to believe that the conclusion is true. Therefore, it is bad argument, but it is still an argument.

              <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Despite the purpose of logic, as the science that evaluates and analyses arguments, is to develop methods and techniques that allow us to distinguish good arguments from bad, one of the most important tasks in the analysis of arguments is to distinguish premises from conclusion and vice versa. Sometimes identifying a conclusion from premises is very tough. Premises and conclusions are difficult to identify for a number of reasons.

               <p class="text-gray-600">
                 Even though all arguments are ideally presumed to be composed of premises and a conclusion, in reality, sometimes arguments may contain other sentences as elements. Moreover, even though it is assumed, for the sake of argument, that all arguments are composed of premises and conclusion, identifying conclusion from argument is very difficult. Since it is impossible to analyze arguments without identifying a conclusion from premises, we need techniques that can help us to identify premises from a conclusion and vice versa.

                The first technique that can be used to identify premises from a conclusion and vice versa is looking at an <strong>indicator word</strong>. Frequently, arguments contain certain indicator words that provide clues in identifying premises and conclusion.

                    Based on the above rule, the premise of this argument is “cheating on exams is punishable by the Senate Legislation of the University” because it follows the premise indicator word “because”, and the other statement is a premise.

                  <p class="text-gray-600 note-box">
                     One premise indicator not included in the above list is “for this reason.” This indicator is special in that it comes immediately *after* the premise it indicates and before the conclusion. We can say that in the middle place between the premise and the conclusion, this indicator can be both premise and conclusion indicator. The statement that comes before “for this reason” is the premise of an argument and the statement that comes after “for this reason” is the conclusion. One should be careful not to confuse “for this reason” with “the reason that.”
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Sometimes a single indicator can be used to identify more than one premise. Consider the following argument:</p>

                     <p>Tsionawit is a faithful wife, for Ethiopian women are faithful wives and Tsionawit an Ethiopian.</p>
                  </div>
                   <p class="text-gray-600">The premise indicator “for” goes with both “Ethiopian women are faithful wives” and “Tsionawit is an Ethiopian”. These are the premises. By process of elimination, “Tsionawit is a faithful wife” is the conclusion.</p>

                   An argument is a systematic combination of one or more than one statements, which are claimed to provide a logical support or evidence (i.e., premise(s) to another single statement which is claimed to follow logically from the alleged evidence (i.e., conclusion). However, not all passages that contain two or more statements are argumentative. There are various passages that contain two or more statements but are not argumentative.

                       <p class="italic text-gray-600">Dear learners, what do you think are argumentative passages? What qualifies a passage to be an argument?</p>
                   </div>
                  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                    Evaluating arguments about different issues in human life like those that address, religion, politics, ethics, sport, science, love, culture, environment, society, culture etc. is the central concern of logic. Therefore, as logicians, in order to evaluate arguments easily, we need to understand the nature of arguments and further we need to understand what argument is not, because not all passages contain argument. Since logic deals with arguments, it is important for students to develop the ability to identify whether passages contain an argument. In a general way, a passage contains an argument if it purports to prove something; if it does not do so, it does not contain an argument.
                  </p>
                   <p class="text-gray-600">But what does it mean to purport to prove something?</p>
               </div>

               <!-- Slide 29: Conditions for Argument -->
               <div class="slide">
                  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Conditions for Purporting to Prove Something</h2>
                  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Two conditions must be fulfilled for a passage to purport to prove something:</p>
                   <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
                     <li>At least one of the statements must claim to present evidence or reasons.</li>
                     <li>There must be a claim that the alleged evidence or reasons supports or implies something- that is, a claim that something follows from the alleged evidence.</li>
                   </ol>
                   <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                     As we have seen earlier, the statements that claim to present the evidence or reasons are the premises and the statement that the evidence is claimed to support or imply is the conclusion. Hence, the first condition refers to premises as it tries to provide or claim to provide reasons or evidences for the conclusion; and the second condition refers to a conclusion. It is not necessary that the premises present actual evidence or true reasons nor that do the premises actually do support the conclusion. But at least the premises must claim to present evidence or reasons, and there must be a claim that the evidence or reasons support or imply something.
                   </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                      The first condition expresses a <strong>factual claim</strong>, and the second condition expresses what is called an <strong>inferential claim</strong>. The first condition falls largely outside the domain of logic. Thus, most of our attention will be concentrated on whether the second condition is fulfilled. The second condition expresses what is called an inferential claim.
                    </p>

                 <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Inferential Claim</h2>
                  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                    The inferential claim is simply the claim that the passage expresses a certain kind of reasoning process- that something supports or implies something or that something follows from something. Also, you should recognize that this claim is not equitable with the intentions of the arguer. Intentions are subjective and, as such, are usually not accessible to the evaluator. Rather, the inferential claim is an objective feature of an argument grounded in its language or structure.
                  </p>
                   <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                     In evaluating arguments, therefore, most of our attention will be concentrated on whether the second condition is fulfilled because it is not necessary, at least at this level, that the premises present actual evidence or true reasons nor that do the premises actually support the conclusion.
                   </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">An inferential claim can be either <strong>explicit</strong> or <strong>implicit</strong>. An <strong>explicit inferential claim</strong> is usually asserted by premise or conclusion indicator words ("thus,” “since,” “because,” “hence,” “therefore,” and so on). It exists if there is an indicator word that asserts an explicit relationship between the premises and the conclusions.</p>

                   <p class="text-gray-600">In this example, the premise indicator word “because” expresses the claim that evidence supports something, or that evidence is provided to prove something. Hence, the passage is an argument.</p>

                   <p class="text-gray-600">The inferential relationship between the first statement and the other two constitutes an implicit claim that evidence supports something, so we are justified in calling the passage an argument though it does not contain indicator word.

                     <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                       Sometimes it is difficult to identify whether a passage contain an argument. In deciding whether there is a claim that evidence supports or implies something keep an eye out for (1) indicator words, and (2) the presence of an inferential claim between the statements. In connection with these points, however, a word of caution is in order.
                     </p>
                     <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                       First, the mere occurrence of an indicator word by no means guarantees the presence of an argument. The presence of an indicator word does not mean that the existing indicator word actually and always indicate a premises or a conclusion. Thus, before deciding that an indicator word indicates a premises or a conclusion, make sure that the existing indicator word is used to indicate a premise or a conclusion.
                     </p>
                     <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Example:</p>

                       In the first passage the word “since” is used in a temporal sense. It means “from the time that.” Thus, the first passage is not an argument. In the second passage “since” is used in a logical sense, and so the passage is an argument.

                     Second, it is not always easy to detect the occurrences of an inferential relationship between statements in a passage, and the reader may have to review a passage several times before making a decision. Therefore, in deciding whether a passage contains an argument one should try to insert mentally some indicators words among the statements to see whether there is a flow of ideas among the statements. Even with this mental experiment, however, deciding whether a passage contains an argument is very difficult. As a result, not everyone will agree about every passage. Sometimes the only answer possible is a conditional one: “If this passage contains an argument, then these are the premises and that is the conclusion.”

                      To assists in distinguishing passages that contain arguments from those that do not, it is important to identify passages, which do not contain arguments: Non-argumentative passages.

                      Having seen what arguments are and how we recognize them, we will now focus on what arguments are not and how we recognize them. Non-argumentative passages are passages, which lack an inferential claim. These include simple non-inferential passages, expository passages, illustrations, explanations, and conditional statements. Passages that lack an inferential claim may be statements, which could be premises, conclusion, or both. What is missed is a claim that a reasoning process is being made. As was discussed previously, for a passage to be an argument, it not only should contain premises and a conclusion but also an inferential claim or a reasoning process. In this portion of our , we will discuss some of the most important forms of non-argumentative passages.

Passages of this sort include warnings, pieces of advice, statements of belief or opinion, loosely associated statements, and reports.

                          An <strong>expository passage</strong> is a kind of discourse that begins with a topic sentence followed by one or more sentences that develop the topic sentence. If the objective is not to prove the topic sentence but only to expand it or elaborate it, then there is no argument.

                            One of the most important kinds of non-argument is the <strong>explanation</strong>. An <strong>explanation</strong> is an expression that purports to shed light on some event or phenomenon, which is usually accepted as a matter of fact. It attempts to clarify, or describe such alike why something is happen that way or why something is what it is.

In the first example, the explanandum is the statement “Cows digest grass while humans cannot” and the explanans is “their [cows’] digestive systems contain enzyme not found in humans.”</p>

                           Explanations are sometimes mistaken for arguments because they often contain the indicator word “because.” Yet explanations are not arguments, because in an explanation the purpose of the explanans is to shed light on, or to make sense of, the explanandum event, not to prove that it occurred. In other words, the purpose of the explanans is to show why something is the case, whereas in an argument, the purpose of the premises is to prove that something is the case. That is, the premise refers to an accepted fact, and intended to prove that something is the case, while the conclusion is a new assertion followed from the already known fact. Moreover, in explanation, we precede backward from fact to the cause whereas in argument we move from premise to the conclusion.

                            In the above example given, the fact that cows digest grass but humans cannot is readily apparent to everyone. The statement that cows’ digestive systems contain enzyme not found in humans is not intended to prove that cows digest grass but humans cannot, but rather to show why it is so.

                             Explanations bear a certain similarity to an argument. The rational link between the explanandum and explanans may at times resemble the inferential link between the premise and the conclusion of an argument. Thus, to distinguish explanations from arguments, first identify the statement that is either the explanandum or the conclusion (usually this is the statement that precedes the word “because”). If this statement describes an accepted matter of fact, and if the remaining statements purport to shed light on this statement, then the passage is an explanation.

                            The purpose of this passage could be to prove the first statement to those who do not accept it as fact, and to shed light on that fact to those who do accept it. Alternately, the passage could be intended to prove the first statement to a person who accepts its truth on blind faith or incomplete experience, and simultaneously to shed light on this truth. Thus, this passage can be correctly interpreted as both an explanation and an argument.

                             Perhaps the greatest problem confronting the effort to distinguish explanations from arguments lies in determining whether something is an accepted matter of fact. Obviously, what is accepted by one person may not be accepted by another. Thus, the effort often involves determining which person or group of people the passage is directed to- the intended audience. Sometimes the source of the passage (textbook, newspaper, technical journal, etc.) will decide the issue. But when the passage is taken totally out of context, ascertaining the source may prove impossible. In those circumstances the only possible answer may be to say that if the passage is an argument, then such-and-such is the conclusion and such-and-such are the premises.

                             In deciding whether an illustration should be interpreted as an argument, determine whether the passage merely shows how something is done or what something means, or whether it also purports to prove something. In borderline cases, it helps to note whether the claim being illustrated is one that practically everyone accepts or agrees with. If it is, the passage is probably not an argument. As already noted, in real-life situations, authors rarely attempt to prove what everyone already accepts. But if the claim being illustrated is one that many people do not accept or have never thought about, then the passage may be interpreted as an argument.

                              Conditional statements are not arguments, because they fail to meet the criteria given earlier. In an argument, at least one statement must claim to present evidence, and there must be a claim that this evidence implies something. In a conditional statement, there is no claim that either the antecedent or the consequent presents evidence. In other words, there is no assertion that either the antecedent or the consequent is true. Rather, there is only the assertion that if the antecedent is true, then so is the consequent. For example, the above example merely asserts that if you study hard, then you will score ‘A’. It does not assert that you study hard. Nor does it assert you scored ‘A’.

                             Of course, a conditional statement as a whole may present evidence because it asserts a relationship between statements. Yet when conditional statements are taken in this sense, there is still no argument, because there is then no separate claim that this evidence implies anything. Therefore, a single conditional statement is not an argument. The fact that a statement begin with “if” makes it the idea conditional and not a final reasonable assertion. That is why also conditional statements are not evaluated as true or false without separately evaluating the antecedent and the consequent. They only claim that if the antecedent is true then so is the consequent.
                           </p>

                             However, some conditional statements are similar to arguments in that they express the outcome of a reasoning process. As such, they may be said to have a certain inferential content. Consider the following example:
                           </p>
                            <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600">

                              Accordingly, conditional statements are not arguments. Yet, although taken by themselves are not arguments, their inferential content, (the inferential content between the antecedent and the consequent), may be re-expressed to form arguments. For example, the conditional statement can be re-expressed to form an argument as follows:
                           </p>
                           <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600">

                             Conditional statements are especially important in logic (and many other fields) because they express the relationship between necessary and sufficient conditions. A is said to be a <strong>sufficient condition</strong> for B whenever the occurrence of A is all that is needed for the occurrence of B. For example, being a dog is a sufficient condition for being an animal. On the other hand, B is said to be a <strong>necessary condition</strong> for A Whenever A cannot occur without the occurrence of B. Thus, being an animal is a necessary condition for being a dog.
                           </p>
                           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                             The difference between sufficient and necessary conditions is a bit tricky. So, to clarify the idea further, suppose you are given a large, closed cardboard box. Also, suppose you are told that there is a dog in the box. Then you know for sure, there is an animal in the box. No additional information is needed to draw this conclusion. This means that being a dog is sufficient for being an animal. However, being a dog is not necessary for being an animal, because if you are told that the box contains a cat, you can conclude with equal certainty that it contains an animal. In other words, it is not necessary for the box to contain a dog for it to contain an animal. It might equally well contain a cat, a mouse, a squirrel, or any other animal.

                              On the other hand, suppose you are told that whatever might be in the box, it is not an animal. Then you know for certain there is no dog in the box. The reason you can draw this conclusion is that being an animal is necessary for being a dog. If there is no animal, there is no dog. However, being an animal is not sufficient for being a dog, because if you are told that the box contains an animal, you cannot, from this information alone, conclude that it contains a dog. It might contain a cat, a mouse, a squirrel, and so on.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">These ideas are expressed in the following conditional statements:</p>
                            <div class="border border-gray-300 p-4 rounded mb-4 italic text-gray-600">
                              <p>If X is a dog, then X is an animal.</p>
                              <p>If X is not an animal, then X is not a dog.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">The first statement says that being a dog is a sufficient condition for being an animal, and the second that being an animal is a necessary condition for being a dog. However, a little reflection reveals that these two statements say exactly the same thing. Thus, each expresses in one way a necessary condition and in another way a sufficient condition.</p>

                              In our previous , we saw that every argument involves an inferential claim- the claim that the conclusion is supposed to follow from the premises. Every argument makes a claim that its premises provide grounds for the truth of its conclusion. The question we now address has to do with the strength of this claim. Just how strongly is the conclusion claimed to follow from the premises. The reasoning process (inference) that an argument involves is expressed either with certainty or with probability. That is what the logician introduced the name <strong>deduction</strong> and <strong>induction</strong> for, respectively.

                             <p class="text-gray-600">
                               If the conclusion is claimed to follow with strict certainty or necessity, the argument is said to be deductive; but if it is claimed to follow only probably, the argument is said to be inductive. Therefore, a conclusion may be supported by its premise in two very different ways. These two different ways are the two great classes of arguments: Deductive arguments and Inductive arguments. And the distinction between these two classes of arguments, because every argument involves an inferential claim, lies in the strength of their inferential claim. Understanding the distinction of these classes is essential in the study of logic. In this , we will learn the broad groups of arguments, Deductive arguments and Inductive arguments, and the techniques of distinguishing one from the other.

In such arguments, the conclusion is claimed to follow necessarily (conclusively) from the premises. Thus, deductive arguments are those that involve necessary reasoning.

In such arguments, the conclusion is claimed to follow only probably from the premises. The premises may provide some considerable evidence for the conclusion but they do not imply (necessarily support) the conclusion. In this case, we might have sufficient condition (evidence) but we cannot be certain about the truth of the conclusion. However, this does not mean that the conclusion is wrong or unacceptable, where as it could be correct or acceptable but only based on probability. Thus, inductive arguments are those that involve probabilistic reasoning.

That is, the conclusion is claimed to follow from the premises only probably; or the premises are claimed to support their corresponding conclusion with a probability. In other words, if we assume that the premises are true, then based on that assumption it is probable that the conclusion is true. If we, for example, assume that most African leaders were blacks and that Mandela was an African leader, then it is improbable that Mandela not been a black, or it is probable that Mandela was black. But it is not impossible that Mandela not been a black. Similarly, if we assume that almost all women are mammals and that Hanan is a woman, then it is improbable that Hanan not be a mammal, or it is probable that Hanan is a mammal.

                                <p class="text-gray-600">Dear learners, we have said earlier that the distinction between inductive and deductive arguments lies on how strongly the conclusion is claimed to follow from the premises, or how strongly the premises are claimed to support the conclusion. However, in most arguments, the strength of this claim is not explicitly stated, so we must use our interpretative abilities to evaluate it. In the deciding whether an argument is deductive or inductive, we must look at certain objective features of the argument.</p>

                                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">There are three factors that influence the decision about the deductiveness or inductiveness of an argument’s inferential claim. These are:</p>
                                <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-1">
                                   <li>The occurrence of special indicator words,</li>

                                   <li>The character or form of argumentation the arguers use.</li>
                                </ol>
                                 <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                                   However, we must acknowledge at the outset that many arguments in ordinary language are incomplete, and because of this, deciding whether the argument should best be interpreted as deductive or inductive may be impossible. Let us see the above factors in detail in order to understand and identify the different styles of argumentation.
                                 </p>
                                  <p class="text-gray-600">
                                    The first factor that influences our decision about a certain inferential claim is the occurrence of <strong>special indicator words</strong>. There are different sort of indicator words that indicate or mark the type of a certain argument. Arguments may contain some words that indicate the arguer’s certainty and confidence, or the arguer’s uncertainty or doubt, about the truth of his/her conclusion. Words like “certainly,” “necessarily,” “absolutely,” and “definitely” indicate that the argument should be taken as deductive, whereas words like, “probable,” “improbable,” “plausible,” “implausible,” “likely,” “unlikely,” and “reasonable to conclude” suggest that an argument is inductive.
                                  </p>

                                 <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                                   The point is that if an argument draws its conclusion, using either of the deductive indicator words, it is usually best to interpret it as deductive, but if it draws its conclusion, using either of the inductive indicator words, it is usually best to interpret it as inductive. (Note that the phrase “it must be the case that” is ambiguous; “must” can indicate either probability or necessity).
                                 </p>

                                    Deductive and Inductive indicator words often suggest the correct interpretation. However, one should be cautious about these special indicator words, because if they conflict with one of the other criteria, we should probably ignore them. For arguers often use phrases such as “it certainly follows that” for rhetorical purposes to add impact to their conclusion and not to suggest that the argument be taken as deductive. Similarly, some arguers, not knowing the distinction between inductive and deductive, will claim to “deduce” a conclusion when their argument is more correctly interpreted as inductive. If one takes these words at face value, then one might wrongly leads into wrong conclusions. Therefore, the occurrence of an indicator word is not a certain guarantee for the deductiveness or inductiveness of an argument unless it is supported by the other features. This leads us to consider the second factor.

                                    The second factor that bears upon our interpretation of an argument as inductive or deductive is the <strong>actual strength of the inferential link between premises and conclusion</strong>. If the conclusion actually does follow with strict necessity from the premises, the argument is clearly deductive. In such an argument, it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. If, on the other hand, the conclusion of an argument does not follow with strict necessity but does follow probably, it is usually best to interpret it as inductive argument. Consider the following examples.

                                   In the first example, the conclusion follows with strict necessity from the premises. If we assume that all Ethiopian people love their country and that Debebe is an Ethiopian, then it is impossible that Debebe not love his country. Thus, we should interpret this argument as deductive. In the second example, the conclusion does not follow from the premises with strict necessity, but it does follow with some degree of probability. If we assume that the premises are true, then based on that assumption it is probable that the conclusion is true. Thus, it is best to interpret the second argument as inductive.

                                  Occasionally, an argument contains no special indicator words, and the conclusion does not follow either necessarily or probably from the premises; in other words, it does not follow at all. This situation points up the need for the third factor to be taken into account, which is the <strong>character or form of argumentation the arguer uses</strong>. Let us see some examples of deductive argumentative forms and inductive argumentative forms.

                                  Many arguments have a distinctive character or form that indicates that the premises are supposed to provide absolute support for the conclusion. Five examples of such forms or kinds of argumentation are arguments based on mathematics, arguments from definition, and syllogisms: categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive syllogisms.
                                </p>

                                   <strong>Argument based on mathematics:</strong> it is an argument in which the conclusions depend on some purely arithmetic or geometric computation or measurement. For example, you can put two orange and three bananas in a bag and conclude that the bag contains five fruits. Or again you can measure a square pieces of land and after determining it is ten meter on each side conclude that its area is a hundred square meter. Since all arguments in pure mathematics are deductive, we can usually consider arguments that depend on mathematics to be deductive as well. A noteworthy exception, however, is arguments that depend on statistics are usually best interpreted as inductive.

For example, one may argue that Angel is honest; it is follows that Angel tells the truth. Or again, Kebede is a physician; therefore, he is a doctor. These arguments are deductive because their conclusions follow with necessity from the definitions “honest” and “physician”.

                                   In general, inductive arguments are such that the content of the conclusion is in some way intended to “go beyond” the content of the premises. The premises of such an argument typically deal with some subject that is relatively familiar, and the conclusion then moves beyond this to a subject that is less familiar or that little is known about. Such an argument may take any of several forms: predictions about the future, arguments from analogy, inductive generalizations, arguments from authority, arguments based on signs, and causal inferences, to name just a few.

For example, one may argue that because certain clouds develop in the center of the highland, a rain will fall within twenty-four hours. Nearly everyone realizes that the future cannot be known with certainty. Thus, whenever an argument makes a prediction about the future one is usually justified considering the argument inductive.

Because of the existence of this analogy a certain conditions that affects the better- known thing or situations is concluded to affect the less familiar , lesser known-thing or situation. For instance, one may conclude, after observing the similarity of some features of Computer A and car B: that both are manufactured in 2012; that both are easy to access; that Computer A is fast in processing; it follows that Computer B is also fast in processing. This argument depends on the existence of a similarity or analogy between the two cars. The certitude attending such an inference is obviously probabilistic at best.

                                   <strong>An argument from authority:</strong> it is an argument in which the conclusions rest upon a statement made by some presumed authority or witness. A lawyer, for instance, may argue that the person is guilty because an eyewitness testifies to that effect under oath. Or again one may argue that all matters are made up of a small particles called “quarks” because the University Professor said so. Because the professor and the eyewitness could be either mistaken or lying, such arguments are essentially probabilistic.

                                    <strong>Arguments based on sign:</strong> it is an argument that proceeds from the knowledge of a certain sign to the knowledge of a thing or situation that the sign symbolizes. For instance, one may infer that after observing a ‘No Parking’ sign posted on the side of a road, the area is not allowed for parking. But because the sign might be displaced or in error about the area or forgotten, conclusion follows only probably.

                                     <strong>A causal inference:</strong> it is an argument which proceed from the knowledge of a cause to the knowledge of an effect, or conversely, from the knowledge of an effect to knowledge of a cause. For example, from the knowledge that a bottle of water had been accidentally left in the freezer overnight, someone might conclude that it had frozen (cause to effect). Conversely, after tasting a piece of chicken and finding it dry and tough, one might conclude that it had been overcooked (effect to cause). Because specific instances of cause and effect can never be known with absolute certainty, one may usually interpret such an argument as inductive.

                                   It should be noted that the various subspecies of inductive arguments listed here are not intended to be mutually exclusive. Overlaps can and do occur. For example, many causal inferences that proceed from cause to effect also qualify as predictions. We should take care not to confuse arguments in geometry, which are always deductive, with arguments from analogy or inductive generalizations. For example, an argument concluding that a triangle has a certain attribute (such as a right angle) because another triangle, with which it is congruent, also has that attribute might be mistaken for an argument from analogy.

                                   A final point needs to be made about the distinction between inductive and deductive arguments. There is a tradition extending back to the time of Aristotle that holds that inductive arguments are those that proceed from the particular to the general, while deductive arguments are those that proceed from the general to the particular. (A particular statement is one that makes a claim about one or more particular members of a class, while a general statement makes a claim about all the members of a class.)
                                 </p>

                                    In fact, there are deductive arguments that proceed from the general to the general, from the particular to the particular, and from the particular to the general, as well as from the general to the particular; and there are inductive arguments that do the same.
                                  </p>
                                   <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">For example, here is a deductive argument that proceeds from the particular to the general:</p>

                                     <p>Seven is a prime number.</p>
                                     <p>Therefore, all odd numbers between two and eight are prime numbers.</p>

                                   In our previous , we have seen that every argument makes two basic claims: a claim that evidence or reasons exist and a claim that the alleged evidence or reasons support something (or that something follows from the alleged evidence or reasons). The first is a factual claim, and the second is an inferential claim. The evaluation of every argument centers on the evaluation of these two claims. The most important of the two is the inferential claim, because if the premises fail to support the conclusion (that is, if the reasoning is bad), an argument is worthless. Thus, we will always test the inferential claim first, and only if the premises do support the conclusion will we test the factual claim (that is, the claim that the premises present genuine evidence, or are true). In this , we will be introduced with the central ideas and terminologies required to evaluate arguments. And the primary purpose of this is to introduce you with the natures of good arguments both in deductive and inductive arguments. Hence, you will learn effective techniques and strategies for evaluating arguments.

                                    The previous section defined a deductive argument as one in which the premises are claimed to support the conclusion in such a way that if they are assumed true, it is impossible for the conclusions to be false. If the premises do in fact support the conclusions in this way the arguments is said to be <strong>valid</strong>; if not, it is <strong>invalid</strong>. Thus, a <strong>valid deductive argument</strong> is an argument such that if the premises are assumed true, it is impossible for the conclusion to be false. In such arguments, the conclusion follows with strict necessity from the premises.

In these arguments, the conclusion does not follow with strict necessity from the premises, even though it is claimed to. Consider the following examples:

                                     The above definitions of valid and invalid arguments, along with their corresponding examples, lead us into two immediate conclusions. The first is that there is no middle ground between valid and invalid. An argument is either valid or invalid. The second consequence is that there is only an indirect relation between validity and truth. For an argument to be valid it is not necessary that either the premises or the conclusions be true, but merely that if the premises assumed true, it is impossible for the conclusion be false. That is, we do not have to know whether the premise of an argument is actually true in order to determine its validity (valid or invalid).

                                      To test an argument for validity, we begin by assuming that all premises are true, and then we determine if it is possible, in light of that assumption, for the conclusion to be false. Thus, the validity of argument is the connection between premise and conclusion rather than on the actual truth or falsity of the statement formed the argument.

                                        In general, the basic idea of evaluating deductive argument, validity (valid and invalid) is not something that is determined by the actual truth or falsity of the premises and conclusion. Rather, validity is something that is determined by the relationship between premises and conclusion. The question is not whether premises and conclusion are true or false, but whether the premises support the conclusion. Nevertheless, there is one arrangement of truth and falsity in the premises and conclusion that does determine the issue of validity. Any deductive argument having actually true premises and an actually false conclusion is invalid for the reason given above. The idea that any deductive argument having actually true premises and a false conclusion is invalid may be the most important point in the entire system of deductive logic. The entire system of deductive logic would be quite useless if it accepted as valid any inferential process by which a person could start with truth in the premises and arrive at falsity in the conclusion.

                                        We said earlier that the evaluation of every argument centers on the evaluation of two claims: the inferential claim and factual claim of the argument. We have also said that we will always test the inferential claim first, and only if the premises do support the conclusion will we test the factual claim (that is, the claim that the premises present genuine evidence, or are true). Now that we have tested the inferential claims of deductive arguments, it is time to proceed to the next step: evaluating the factual claims of deductive arguments.

                                        Depending on their actual ability, (assuming that they already have actually accomplished their inferential claims by being valid), to accomplish their factual claims, deductive arguments can be either <strong>sound</strong> or <strong>unsound</strong>. A <strong>sound argument</strong> is a deductive argument that is valid and has all true premises. Both conditions must be met for an argument to be sound, and if either is missing the argument is unsound. A deductive argument that does not actually accomplish its inferential claim, (that is not valid), cannot be sound, regardless of the truth values of its premises. Such a deductive argument is unsound, by definition. Thus, an <strong>unsound argument</strong> is a deductive argument that is either valid with one or more false premises, or invalid, or both.

                                         The previous section defined an inductive argument as one in which the premises are claimed to support the conclusions in such a way that if they are assumed true, it is improbable for the conclusions to be false. If the premises do in fact support the conclusions in this way the arguments is said to be <strong>strong</strong>; if not, it is <strong>weak</strong>. Thus, a <strong>strong inductive argument</strong> is an argument such that if the premises are assumed true, it is improbable for the conclusion to be false. In such arguments, the conclusion follows probably from the premises. Conversely, a <strong>weak inductive argument</strong> is an argument such that if the premises are assumed true, it is probable for the conclusions to be false. In these arguments, the conclusion does not follow probably from the premises, even though it is claimed to. Consider the following examples:

                                           Just as what happened from definitions and examples of valid and invalid arguments earlier, two immediate conclusions follow from the above definitions and examples of strong and weak arguments. The first is that, unlike the validity and invalidity of deductive arguments, the strength and weakness of inductive arguments admit certain form of degrees. To be considered strong, an inductive argument must have a conclusion that is more probable than improbable. In inductive arguments, there is no absolutely strong nor absolutely weak argument. For instance, the first is not absolutely weak nor the second absolutely strong. Both arguments would be strengthened or weakened by the random selection of a larger or smaller sample. The incorporation of additional premises into inductive arguments will also generally tend to strength or weaken it. For example, if the premise “one un-tasty apple that had been found earlier was removed” were added to the second argument, the argument would presumably be weakened.

                                         <p class="text-gray-600">
                                           The second consequence is that, as validity and invalidity, strength and weakness are only indirectly related to the truth values of their premises. The central question in determining strength or weakness is whether the conclusion would probably true if the premises are assumed true. For an argument to be strong it is not necessary that either the premises or the conclusions be true, but merely that if the premises assumed true, it is improbable for the conclusion be false. That is, we do not have to know whether the premise of an argument is actually true in order to determine its strength (strong or weak). To test an argument for strength, what we need to do is to assume the premise true and then to see whether the conclusion follows more/less probably from the premise. Thus, the strength or weakness of an inductive argument results not from the actual truth or falsity of the premises and conclusion, but from the probabilistic support the premises give to the conclusion.

That is, the second case does not allow for strong arguments. As we have just seen, any argument having this combination is necessarily weak.

                                              In general, the basic idea of evaluating inductive argument, strength is not something that is determined by the actual truth or falsity of the premises and conclusion, but by the relationship between premises and conclusion. Nevertheless, there is one arrangement of truth and falsity in the premises and conclusion that does determine the issue of strength. Thus, any inductive argument having actually true premises and an actually false conclusion is weak.

                                            We said earlier that the evaluation of every argument centers on the evaluation of two claims: the inferential claim and factual claim of the argument. We have also said that we will always test the inferential claim first, and only if the premises do support the conclusion will we test the factual claim (that is, the claim that the premises present genuine evidence, or are true). Now that we have tested the inferential claims of inductive arguments, it is time to proceed to the next step: evaluating the factual claims of inductive arguments.

                                            Depending on their actual ability, (assuming that they already have actually accomplished their inferential claims by being strong), to accomplish their factual claims, inductive arguments can be either <strong>cogent</strong> or <strong>uncogent</strong>. A <strong>cogent argument</strong> is an inductive argument that is strong and has all true premises. Both conditions must be met for an argument to be cogent, and if either is missing the argument is uncogent. An inductive argument that does not actually accomplish its inferential claim, (that is not strong), cannot be cogent, regardless of the truth values of its premises. Such an inductive argument is uncogent, by definition. Thus, an <strong>uncogent argument</strong> is an inductive argument that is either strong with one or more false premises, or weak, or both.

In a sound argument, it is only necessary that the premises be true and nothing more. Given such premises and good reasoning, a true conclusion is guaranteed. In a cogent argument, on the other hand, the premises must not only be true, they must also not ignore some important piece of evidence that outweighs the given evidence and entails a quite different conclusion. That is, if the premises reflect all the important factors, then the argument is cogent; if not, then obviously the argument is not cogent. Thus, for cogency, the premises must not only be true but also not overlook some important factor that outweighs the given evidence and requires a different conclusion.</p>

                                             Logic is a science that evaluates arguments; and takes argumentation and reasoning as its primary subject of study. The primary aim of logic is to develop a system of methods and principles that we may use as criteria for evaluating the arguments of others and as guides in constructing arguments of our own. The study of logic increases students’ confidence to criticize the arguments of others and advance arguments of their own. An argument is a systematic combination of one or more than one premises and one and only conclusion. A premise is a statement, which is claimed to provide a logical support or evidence to a single another statement, called conclusion. Conclusion is a statement, which is claimed to logically drawn from the alleged evidence. An argument can be either good or bad argument, depending on the logical ability of its premise(s) to support its conclusion.

                                              Not all passages, however, contain an argument. In deciding whether a passage contains an argument, you should look for three things: (1) indicator words: premise or conclusion indicator words; (2) an inferential relationship between the premises and conclusion; and (3) typical kinds of non-arguments. But remember that the mere occurrence of an indicator word does not guarantee the presence of an argument. You must check whether the statement identified as the conclusion is claimed to be supported by one or more of the other statements. It is also important to keep in mind that in many arguments that lack indicator words, the conclusion is the first statement. Furthermore, it helps to mentally insert the word “therefore” before the various statements before deciding that a statement should be interpreted as a conclusion.

                                              Arguments are generally divided into two: deductive arguments and inductive arguments. A deductive argument is an argument in which the premises are claimed to support the conclusion in such a way that if they are assumed true, it is impossible for the conclusions to be false. An inductive argument is an argument in which the premises are claimed to support the conclusion in such a way that if they are assumed true, it is improbable for the conclusions to be false. To distinguish deductive arguments from inductive arguments, or vice versa, we look for: (1) special indicator words, (2) the actual strength of the inferential link between premises and conclusion, and (3) the character or form of argumentation. If the conclusion follows with strict necessity from the premises, the argument is always deductive; if not, it could be either deductive or inductive depending on the other factors.

                                               To evaluate an argument’s actual accomplishment of its inferential and factual claims, two separate questions need to be answered: first, do the premises support the conclusion? Second, are all the premises true? To answer the first question, we begin by assuming the premises true. Then, for deductive arguments, we determine whether, in light of this assumption, it necessarily follows that the conclusion is true. If it does, the argument is valid; if not, it is invalid. For inductive arguments, we determine whether it probably follows that the conclusion is true. If it does, the argument is strong; if not, it is weak. Finally, if the argument is either valid or strong, we turn to the second question and determine whether the premises are actually true. If all the premises are true, the argument is sound (in the case of deduction) or cogent (in the case of induction). All invalid deductive arguments are unsound, and all weak inductive arguments are uncogent.
