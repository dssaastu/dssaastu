                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>In an era marked by rapid technological advancements, globalization, and complex societal challenges, the ability to think creatively and generate innovative solutions has become paramount (Henriksen et al., 2016; Zhao, 2012). Consequently, developing creativity in education has emerged as a key priority for educators, policymakers, and researchers worldwide (Craft, 2003; Erez et al., 2015). However, despite the growing recognition of its importance, the effective integration of creativity into educational settings remains a complex and multifaceted challenge. This article explores the limits of creativity in education, examining the inherent tensions and dilemmas that arise when attempting to cultivate creative thinking within structured educational systems.</p>
                    <p>The article draws upon a range of insights, including research on organizational creativity (Anderson & Gasteiger, 2018; Goffee, 2000), the impact of culture on innovation (Erez et al., 2015), and the specific challenges faced by educators in developing creativity (Craft, 2003; Zhao, 2012). It argues that a comprehensive understanding of the limitations and dilemmas surrounding creativity in education is essential for developing effective strategies to promote its development. By addressing these challenges, we can move towards educational environments that nurture not only academic achievement but also the creative potential of all learners.</p>

                    <h2>Defining Creativity and Its Importance in Education</h2>
                    <p>Defining creativity has been a persistent challenge for researchers and practitioners alike (Sternberg, 1999). While various definitions exist, a common thread emphasizes the generation of novel and effective ideas or products (Amabile, 1996; Sternberg & O'Hara, 1999). Mishra and Koehler (2008) further refine this definition by introducing the concept of “wholeness,” which emphasizes the aesthetic and contextual appropriateness of creative outputs. This "NEW" definition—novel, effective, and whole—provides a useful framework for understanding creativity in educational contexts.</p>
                    <p>The importance of creativity in education is increasingly recognized as a crucial 21st-century skill (Henriksen et al., 2016). Creativity is not merely about artistic expression but encompasses a broader set of cognitive abilities, including problem-solving, critical thinking, and adaptability (Erez et al., 2015). These skills are essential for overcoming a rapidly changing world and addressing complex challenges in various domains. Moreover, research suggests that developing creativity in education can enhance student engagement, motivation, and overall academic achievement (Craft, 2003).</p>
                    
                    <h2>Systemic Challenges to developing Creativity</h2>
                    <p>Despite the recognized importance of creativity, several systemic factors within educational systems hinder its development. One of the most significant challenges is the tension between standardization and creative exploration (Zhao, 2012). The emphasis on standardized testing and curriculum frameworks, driven by accountability pressures, often prioritizes uniformity and conformity over originality and divergent thinking (Craft, 2003). This emphasis on standardized outcomes can create a climate that stifles creativity, as teachers may feel pressured to focus on test preparation rather than developing students' creative potential.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the structure of educational institutions themselves can pose limitations. The traditional hierarchical organization of schools, with rigid schedules, subject-specific silos, and limited opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration, can inhibit the cross-pollination of ideas that often fuels creativity (Anderson & Gasteiger, 2018; Goffee, 2000). The emphasis on individual achievement and competition, prevalent in many educational systems, may also discourage the collaborative and risk-taking behaviors that are often essential for creative breakthroughs (Erez et al., 2015).</p>

                    <h2>Pedagogical Dilemmas and the Role of the Teacher</h2>
                    <p>Teachers play a crucial role in developing creativity in the classroom, yet they face numerous dilemmas in their attempts to do so. One key dilemma is the balance between providing structure and allowing for freedom and exploration (Craft, 2003). While a certain degree of structure is necessary to ensure that students acquire foundational knowledge and skills, excessive control and prescription can limit opportunities for creative thinking. Teachers must overcome this tension carefully, creating learning environments that provide both guidance and autonomy.</p>
                    <p>Another dilemma arises from the need to assess student learning. Assessing creativity is inherently complex, as it involves evaluating subjective and often intangible qualities (Henriksen et al., 2015; Mishra et al., 2015). Traditional assessment methods, such as multiple-choice tests, are ill-suited to capturing the nuances of creative outputs. Teachers must grapple with the challenge of developing assessment practices that are both rigorous and sensitive to the multifaceted nature of creativity. This requires exploring alternative forms of assessment that recognize process as well as product, and that acknowledge the diverse ways in which creativity can manifest itself (Craft, 2003).</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, teachers' own beliefs and attitudes towards creativity can significantly influence their pedagogical practices (Henriksen & Mishra, 2015). Teachers who value creativity and view themselves as creative individuals are more likely to create environments that develop student creativity (Ewy, 2018). However, teachers may also hold implicit biases or misconceptions about creativity, such as the belief that it is an innate talent possessed by only a few, which can limit their efforts to cultivate it in all students.</p>

                    <h2>Cultural and Societal Influences</h2>
                    <p>The cultivation of creativity is not solely determined by educational practices but is also influenced by broader cultural and societal factors. Cultural values and norms can shape perceptions of creativity and its desirability (Erez et al., 2015). In some cultures, conformity and adherence to tradition may be valued more highly than originality and innovation, potentially hindering the development of creative thinking. For instance, Erez et al. (2015) highlight how high-power-distance cultures may inhibit creativity when working under a supervisor, while individualistic cultures may see reduced fluency in creative ideas when working in peer groups.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, societal attitudes towards risk-taking and failure can impact individuals' willingness to engage in creative endeavors (Goffee, 2000). In societies that place a high premium on success and stigmatize failure, individuals may be less likely to take the risks necessary for creative breakthroughs. Educational systems that reflect these societal values may inadvertently discourage students from experimenting, making mistakes, and learning from them. This is particularly relevant in the context of rapid technological change, where adaptability and a willingness to embrace the unknown are crucial (Skippington, 2015).</p>

                    <h2>The Role of Technology</h2>
                    <p>Technology has the potential to both enhance and hinder creativity in education (Henriksen et al., 2016). On one hand, digital tools and platforms can provide students with new avenues for creative expression, collaboration, and access to information (Erez et al., 2015). For example, multimedia software, online collaborative platforms, and virtual reality environments can offer students opportunities to engage in creative projects that were previously unimaginable.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the integration of technology into education is not without its challenges. The uncritical adoption of technology, without careful consideration of its pedagogical implications, can lead to superficial uses that do not necessarily enhance creativity (Zhao, 2012). Moreover, the prevalence of digital distractions and the potential for technology to develop passive consumption rather than active creation can pose obstacles to developing deep creative engagement.</p>

                    <h2>Addressing the Challenges</h2>
                    <p>Overcoming the limitations and dilemmas of developing creativity in education requires a multifaceted approach that addresses systemic, pedagogical, and societal factors. At the systemic level, there is a need for educational reforms that move away from an overemphasis on standardization and towards more flexible, student-centered approaches (Craft, 2003; Zhao, 2012). This may involve rethinking curriculum frameworks, assessment practices, and the organization of schools to create environments that are more conducive to creative exploration.</p>
                    <p>At the pedagogical level, teachers need support and professional development to cultivate their own creative capacities and develop strategies for developing creativity in their students (Henriksen & Mishra, 2015). This includes developing an understanding of the nature of creativity, learning how to design learning experiences that promote creative thinking, and exploring alternative assessment methods that capture the richness of creative outputs. Teacher education programs have a crucial role to play in preparing future educators to embrace creativity as an integral part of their teaching practice.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, developing a culture of creativity requires a broader societal shift in attitudes towards risk-taking, failure, and the value of diverse perspectives (Erez et al., 2015; Goffee, 2000). This involves challenging the notion that creativity is the sole domain of the arts or a select few individuals and recognizing its importance across all disciplines and aspects of life. It also entails creating environments, both within and beyond schools, that encourage experimentation, collaboration, and the open exchange of ideas.</p>

                    <h2>Recommendations for Future Directions</h2>
                    <p>Based on the challenges and dilemmas discussed, the following recommendations are proposed to guide future efforts in developing creativity in education:</p>
