    <h1>Defining Constitution</h1>
    <p>
        A constitution consists of the fundamental laws of a country. It includes basic rules, regulations, values, beliefs, traditions, norms, customs, standards, and aspirations that govern the internal affairs of a country and guide its foreign relations. It is a document that contains essential principles regarding the distribution of governmental powers and outlines the rights and responsibilities of citizens. The constitution also reflects the economic, political, and social policies of a given country.
    </p>
    <p>
        The constitution is also defined as a body of doctrines and practices that form the fundamental organizing principles of a political system.
    </p>

    <h2>Constitutionalism</h2>
    <p>
        Constitutionalism refers to the way in which public authority is exercised, implemented, or applied according to the law. It is government by constitution, or the practice of government being regulated by a constitution. This concept implies not only the existence of a constitution but also the full realization and proper implementation of its provisions. Constitutionalism fosters a culture where government officials act according to the rule of law. Hence, it is more than just having a constitution—it requires adherence to its principles, ensuring that both government and public officials are accountable for their decisions and actions.
    </p>

    <h2>Purposes and Functions of a Constitution</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Provides a framework for government: The constitution is a plan for organizing the structure and composition of government.</li>
        <li>Grants power to government: The constitution authorizes the government to carry out its tasks and make necessary decisions.</li>
        <li>Limits government power: The constitution sets limits on what public authorities can and cannot do, ensuring that officials operate within legal boundaries and follow the rule of law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Classification of Constitutions</h2>
    <p>
        Constitutions vary between political systems based on principles regarding the distribution of political power, the structural separation of authority among branches of government, and the limitations placed on government authority. Constitutions may differ in form, content, and political arrangements due to factors like historical backgrounds, social traditions, and political practices. In some cases, constitutions result from compromises or consensus between social and political forces. In others, they may be drafted by those in power to secure their own political or socio-economic interests.
    </p>

    <h3>Written vs. Unwritten Constitutions</h3>
    <p>
        A <strong>written constitution</strong> is a single document containing the fundamental principles and rules that define the rights and duties of citizens and the composition and powers of government institutions. Examples include the constitutions of India, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, France, Germany, and the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
        An <strong>unwritten constitution</strong> is based on common traditions, customs, and usages rather than a single legal document. Principles are found in various documents, customs, and conventions. Examples of countries with unwritten constitutions include Great Britain, New Zealand, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.
    </p>

    <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Written Constitutions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Clarity and definiteness; easily accessible to citizens; promotes stability and accountability; allows citizens to understand their rights and duties.</li>
        <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Rigidity; difficult to amend; requires interpretation, which can lead to disputes between government branches.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Unwritten Constitutions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Flexibility and adaptability; easily amended based on public demands; resilient to shocks.</li>
        <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Lack of stability; prone to abuse by irresponsible politicians; confusing to citizens due to its lack of availability in a single document.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rigid vs. Flexible Constitutions</h2>
    <p>
        Constitutions are classified as either rigid or flexible, depending on how difficult they are to amend. A <strong>rigid constitution</strong> has complex procedures for amendment, making changes difficult. A <strong>flexible constitution</strong> is easier to amend, allowing it to adapt to changing circumstances.
    </p>

    <h2>Federal vs. Unitary Constitutions</h2>
    <p>
        A constitution also defines the political structure of a state. <strong>Federal constitutions</strong>, such as those of the United States and Ethiopia, distribute power among sub-national governments (e.g., states or regions). In contrast, <strong>unitary constitutions</strong> concentrate power in the central government, with lower levels of government subject to central authority (e.g., Great Britain).

    <h1>Origins and Development of Constitution and Constitutionalism</h1>

    <p>
        The historical evolution of the constitution can be traced back to early human civilizations. Over time, societies developed governance systems that sought to limit the absolute power of rulers. This desire to balance authority with the rights of the governed laid the foundation for modern constitutionalism. Influences from different cultures and political experiences played a key role in shaping constitutional thought and practices, eventually leading to the development of modern constitutions.
    </p>

    <h2>Early Legal Traditions and Governance</h2>

    <h3>Hammurabi’s Law</h3>
    <p>
        Hammurabi (r. 1792-1750 BC), the ancient Babylonian king, is renowned for creating one of the earliest known legal codes. However, Hammurabi’s laws were not concerned with protecting the rights and freedoms of citizens. Instead, his rules aimed to maintain order and strengthen the authority of the ruler. These laws were believed to be divinely inspired, and disobedience was met with severe punishment. Any opposition to the laws was unacceptable. Although Hammurabi’s law established a form of governance, it did not introduce the modern concept of constitutionalism, as there were no limits on governmental authority.
    </p>

    <h3>Hebrews - Theocratic Constitutionalism</h3>
    <p>
        The Hebrews were pioneers in limiting rulers' absolute power through divine law, a system known as theocratic constitutionalism. They believed that their rulers were agents of God and were morally obligated to serve their subjects justly. When rulers became unjust, prophets, claiming spiritual authority, rose up to challenge and resist them. This practice is considered the first legitimate opposition to authoritarian rule. However, this form of justice was based on religious principles rather than the free will of the governed, and modern political rights were absent from their system.
    </p>

    <h2>Ancient Democratic and Republican Systems</h2>

    <h3>Greeks - Constitutional Democracy</h3>
    <p>
        The Greeks were among the first to implement democratic governance during the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Their constitutional democracy involved direct participation of citizens in decision-making processes. Power was not concentrated in the hands of a few but was shared among all citizens. Mechanisms to limit the power of officeholders were also established. Officials were elected or chosen by vote, and positions were open to all active citizens. However, Greek democracy had its flaws—there were no constitutional limitations on the assembly, leading to excessive democracy, instability, and internal discord.
    </p>

    <h3>Romans - Republican Constitutionalism</h3>
    <p>
        The Romans developed a republican system of governance between 600 BC and 100 BC, characterized by a balance between the people and ruling elites. Power was distributed among various assemblies to create checks and balances. Roman officials were elected for short terms, which prevented the accumulation of power in the hands of a few. The Romans also established a legal system, which became the foundation for modern legal codes in many countries. Although citizens had limited influence in governance, the republican system emphasized the rule of law and constitutional supremacy.
    </p>

    <h2>Medieval Constitutionalism and the Magna Carta</h2>

    <h3>Magna Carta</h3>
    <p>
        The Magna Carta, signed in 1215 AD, is one of the most significant documents in the history of constitutionalism. King John of England, who ruled with unchecked power, was forced by his subjects to agree to this great charter of liberties, which placed limits on the king's authority. The Magna Carta introduced the idea that rulers were not above the law and served as a foundation for modern constitutional systems, including England’s parliamentary democracy, the USA’s presidential system, and the hybrid systems in other countries.
    </p>

    <h2>The Evolution of Modern Constitutionalism</h2>
    <p>
        As societies evolved, so did their understanding of governance and the relationship between the state and its citizens. The principles of limiting governmental power, holding rulers accountable, and ensuring citizens' participation in governance laid the groundwork for the development of modern constitutions. While early constitutional practices were rooted in religion and tradition, the Enlightenment period introduced new ideas about individual rights, the rule of law, and democratic governance, which continue to shape constitutions around the world today.

    <h1>Overview of Constitutional Experiences in Ethiopia</h1>

    <h2>Traditional Constitutions</h2>
    <p>
        The modern Ethiopian Empire, which was created in the last quarter of the 19th century, did not possess a written constitution until 1931. However, this does not mean that the various nations and nationalities of Ethiopia did not have customs and social norms regulating their daily life. The different ethnic entities in the country had their own customary laws and highly developed cultural norms that governed their societies. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For centuries, Ethiopia lived according to traditional documents such as the <i>Fetha Negest</i>, the <i>Kibre Negest</i>, and the <i>Ser’ate Mengist</i>, which provided a legal and administrative framework for governance. These traditional documents were significant in shaping the political and legal systems in the absence of a formal written constitution.
    </p>

    <h3>Fetha Negest (The Law of Kings)</h3>
    <p>
        The <i>Fetha Negest</i> (The Law of Kings) was a combination of religious and secular laws, rather than a clear constitution. Originally written in Arabic by the Coptic Egyptian writer Abu-l Fada’il Ibn al-Assal in the 13th century, it was designed for religious guidance and governance. The laws were compiled from the Old Testament, the New Testament, and Roman law, serving as both religious and state law.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <i>Fetha Negest</i> was used in Ethiopia for many centuries as the primary source of constitutional, civil, and criminal laws. It provided the foundation for the administration of government, with the king believed to derive his authority directly from God. The document established the idea of divine rights of kings, where rulers were thought to possess God-given power, and the throne was hereditary.
    </p>

    <h3>Kibre Negest (The Glory of Kings)</h3>
    <p>
        The <i>Kibre Negest</i>, which means "The Glory of Kings," was another traditional document of constitutional relevance in Ethiopia. Written in the early 14th century by six Ethiopian clerics, it outlined the mythical origins of the Ethiopian royal house and documented the connection to the Solomonic dynasty. 
    </p>
    <p>
        According to the <i>Kibre Negest</i>, the Queen of Sheba visited King Solomon of Israel and bore Menelik I, the first king of Ethiopia. This document served as the primary source of legitimacy for the kings of Ethiopia, stating that only those with Solomonic blood could ascend to the throne.
    </p>

    <h3>Ser’ate Mengist</h3>
    <p>
        The <i>Ser’ate Mengist</i> was another traditional document used as a constitution by the rulers before 1931. It provided administrative protocols and directives in the 19th century. Although it cannot be considered a document of constitutional law in the modern sense, it allocated power among the Crown, its dignitaries, and the Church. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The <i>Ser’ate Mengist</i> laid out a pattern of succession to power, although rivalries among royal family members often disrupted its theoretical guidelines. It established certain ceremonial protocols and was consulted whenever necessary, marking a precursor to formal constitutional governance in Ethiopia.

                        <h1>Modern Constitutional Experiences</h1>
<p>
    In its modern history, Ethiopia has experienced three constitutions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The monarchial constitution (1931, later revised in 1955),</li>
    <li>The 1987 PDRE, and</li>
    <li>The 1995 FDRE constitution.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    These constitutions have reflected their own values and political objectives as per the nature of the successive Ethiopian governments.
</p>

<h2>The 1931 Written Constitution</h2>
<p>
    In the literature of the Ethiopian legal systems, the 1931 constitution has been given wider attention. There are many reasons for this, but the most important being:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>It was the first written modern constitution.</li>
    <li>It furnished the formal basis for government and consolidation of the imperial power.</li>
    <li>It illustrated both the theoretical and practical problems of integrating the traditional political system with Emperor Haile Selassie's policies of modernization and centralization.</li>
    <li>It emphasized the reputation of Haile Selassie as a reformer and modernizer both at home and abroad.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    The constitution was introduced in order to achieve Ethiopia’s diplomatic recognition abroad and to strengthen Haile Selassie's authority at home. The 1931 constitution was not a reform measure in response to popular demands from Ethiopian citizens. There was little or no attention to guaranteeing political freedoms and fundamental human rights to Ethiopians. Rather than creating a limited monarchy, the constitution gave all sovereign power to the emperor. The people were considered mere ‘subjects’ and not as ‘citizens’ with political and civil rights.
</p>
<p>
    The 1931 constitution was formulated to attain the following two basic purposes that would advance the Emperor’s authority and political control:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The constitution was intended to give Ethiopia the image of ‘modernity’ in the international community because Ethiopia was considered an ‘uncivilized’ state in the eyes of western colonial powers.
    </li>
    <li>
        In domestic affairs, the 1931 constitution aimed at providing a legal framework for the subordination of the powerful traditional nobility to the Emperor. It served the interests of the Emperor.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The 1931 constitution can be referred to as the charter of the absolute power of the monarchy. It is considered an instrument of modernization in that it introduced some modern institutions such as:
</p>
<h4>Parliamentary System</h4>
<p>
    The core contribution of the 1931 constitution was the creation of the parliament. The parliament consisted of two chambers (houses), namely, the Senate or upper house (Yehig Mewesegna Meker Bet) and the Chamber of Deputies (Yehig Memria Meker Bet). In this regard, the parliament in its structure was bicameral (having two houses). Those elected to the two houses (chambers) were only noblemen and princes, and their term of office was not limited. However, the constitution did not provide powers and functions to the parliament. It was a weak institution to decide on matters relating to laws. Power to make laws was vested with the Emperor, and the parliament was nominal (superficial), mainly assigned to approve the legislation of the Emperor.
</p>

<h4>Annual Budget System</h4>
<p>
    The second major contribution of the 1931 constitution was the introduction of the idea of providing a fixed annual budget for government. However, the assignment of the budget, as indicated in the constitution, had not been properly implemented.
</p>

<h4>Ministerial System</h4>
<p>
    The constitution provided the institutional framework for the ministerial system. However, the executive branch of government was heavily centralized in the hands of the Emperor. Individually and collectively, the ministers were completely subordinated to the Emperor.
</p>

<h4>The Judiciary</h4>
<p>
    The fourth major contribution of the 1931 constitution was the introduction of two separate systems of courts. These were:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The regular courts that dealt with civil and criminal cases.</li>
    <li>The administrative tribunals which concerned civil cases that affected the government.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    At the top of the court system was the Emperor’s chilot (Yenigus chilot or zufan chilot), where the Emperor reviewed cases and could change any judicial decision.
</p>


<h2>The Revised Constitution of 1955</h2>
<p>
    After nearly a 25-year experiment with a written constitution, Ethiopia entered into the second phase of its constitutional development. The second written constitution of Ethiopia was the Revised Constitution. It was promulgated on 4 November 1955.
</p>
<p>
    The 1955 constitution was similar to that of the 1931. But the political principles and objectives of the 1955 constitution were much clearer in pronouncing the powers and functions of the Imperial government. It also included some provisions bearing advanced democratic ideas compared to the previous written constitution.
</p>
<p>
    The historical and political processes of the Ethiopian state and society influenced the contents and issues addressed in the revised constitution. Like the constitution of 1931, however, the revised constitution did not involve a popular process for ratification; it was a “gift” from the Emperor to his subjects on the occasion of celebrating his twenty-five years in power, i.e., silver jubilee.
</p>
<p>
    In terms of enhancing popular sovereignty, the principles and manners of implementing the revised constitution made little or no progress. There were major historical and political processes that forced the revised constitution to come into being: the act of federation of Eritrea with Ethiopia in 1952.
</p>
<p>
    In its nature, the Eritrean constitution implied a more liberal government that incorporated some elements of democratic society as a result of their colonial tradition. Eritrea, which had been under Italian colonial rule for decades and later under British protectorate, was federated with Ethiopia following the decision made by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in 1952. 
</p>
<p>
    Under the supervision of the United Nations, the Eritrean constitution of 1952 was drafted, providing a separate system of government for Eritrea under the sovereignty of the Ethiopian crown. 
</p>
<p>
    The federation of Eritrea created an abnormal political situation because firstly, the federal act was not strictly federal in its nature; Ethiopia remained a unitary state with the absolute rule of an Emperor, while Eritrea obtained an entirely different government. In other words, there emerged two separate governments based on entirely different principles: an elected government in Eritrea and a monarchy in Ethiopia. Thus, both were exercising different powers over the same territory.
</p>
<p>
    Secondly, in its nature, the Eritrean constitution implied a more liberal government that incorporated some elements of democratic society as a result of their colonial tradition. The origins of the revised constitution were related mainly to the historical factors of the time rather than being simply adapted from foreign constitutions as in the case of the 1931 constitution. It incorporated some new concepts and was much more elaborated than its predecessor.
</p>
<p>
    It has 131 articles divided into eight chapters. The first two chapters, comprising nearly one third of the articles, were concerned with defining the power and authority of the Emperor and the privileges of the imperial family. Only one chapter was reserved to deal with some rights and more duties of the people.
</p>
<p>
    Its undemocratic character can simply be inferred from the emphasis given to the authority of the Emperor. It further developed the centralizing and “modernizing” themes of the 1931 constitution. The Revised Constitution more strongly established the absolute power of the monarch.
</p>
<p>
    It declares the “inviolability of the emperor’s dignity.” He could appoint and dismiss government officials in all branches of government as he wished. The emperor also had the power to dissolve the parliament; any law could not come into effect unless he approved it. The imperial power also extended to the extent of determining the administrative affairs of the church itself.
</p>
<p>
    It consolidated the executive, legislative, and judicial power of Emperor Haile-Selassie. Little or no significance was attached to the need to guarantee political and human rights of the Ethiopian people. In a nutshell, the 1955 revised constitution made the powers and authority of the Emperor absolute and complete in the Ethiopian state and society.

<h2>The 1987 PDRE Constitution</h2>
<p>
    The 1974 Ethiopian revolution resulted in the deposition of Emperor Haile-Selassie from power. The “Derg” controlled political power and emerged as the military government in Ethiopia. The military regime suspended the 1955-revised constitution and began to rule the country by a series of decrees and proclamations. The constitutional process of government was foiled.
</p>
<p>
    In order to deepen its power, the Derg established its single party, the Workers’ Party of Ethiopia (WPE) in 1987. This marked a transition from a no-party system to a one-party system in Ethiopia. In 1987, the ‘Derg’ constitution was issued, justifying its rule. It introduced the first republic by abolishing the system of monarchy in Ethiopia.
</p>
<p>
    The 1987 constitution differed from the previous constitutions in some ways. The constitutional commission, via a program of public “consultation,” drafted it, and it was later ratified in the name of broad popular participation. In principle, some of the provisions of the “Derg” constitution included “democratic” elements. Sovereignty lay with the workers of Ethiopia and was exercised through the National Shengo and local Shengos established by election and referendum. Candidates to the National Shengo were nominated by organs of the Workers' Party of Ethiopia, mass organizations, military units, and other bodies. The terms of the Shengo were set for five years.
</p>
<p>
    The national “Shengo” was, by name, the supreme organ of the state. It was responsible for establishing the subordinate organs of the state and electing the president and other state officials. However, in practice, the actual powers of the “Shengo” were artificial or superficial. The military regime, which claimed to be socialist, centralized all political powers under the leadership of one party system. The 1987 constitution attempted to present the military dictatorship as a popular civilian government.
</p>
<p>
    The Council of Ministers was the highest executive and administrative organ of the PDRE and was accountable to the Shengo. The Judiciary branch consisted of the Supreme Court, courts of administrative and autonomous units, and other courts established by law. The president, vice president, and judges of the Supreme Court were nominated by the president and approved by the Shengo for a five-year term. Other judges were to be elected and recalled by the Shengos at their respective levels.
</p>

<h2>The 1991 Transitional Charter</h2>
<p>
    The ethnic-based liberation movements came together immediately at a conference and drafted and approved an interim constitution, otherwise known as the Transitional Charter. The Charter is a very brief document with only 20 articles. The aspirations stipulated in its preamble include the guarantee of freedom, equal rights, and self-determination of all peoples; ensuring peace and stability by bringing an end to all hostilities, redressing regional prejudices, safeguarding the rights of citizens through democratically elected, accountable government, and rebuilding the country and restructuring the state.
</p>
<p>
    Interestingly, the Charter, despite its briefness, places a high premium on human rights. This is manifested in its direct reference to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in Article 1, which states that based on the UDHR, individual human rights are respected fully and without any limitation whatsoever. In accordance with the aspirations of the Charter, Article 2 recognizes the right of “Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples to self-determination,” thereby guaranteeing their rights to a) preserve their identity, culture, history, and language; b) self-administration with fair and proper representation at the center; and c) independence when the above-mentioned rights are “denied, abridged, or abrogated.”
</p>
<p>
    The Charter, in contrast to Ethiopia’s legal and political tradition, explicitly recognizes the rights of “Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples,” including their right to secession. The process of decentralization initiated by the Charter was further elaborated by the National/Regional Self-Government Establishment Proclamation No. 7/1992. Accordingly, 14 National/Regional self-governments, whose borders were determined based on the settlement structure of nations, nationalities, and peoples, were established. The Transitional Charter established devolved administrative units on the basis of ethnic and linguistic criteria.
</p>
<p>
    Based on the Charter, fourteen regional governments were created; Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa were given autonomy based on political and population considerations. Each regional government has executive, legislative, and judicial powers concerning all matters within their geographic territory, except such matters as defense, foreign affairs, citizenship, declaration of a state of emergency, national economic policy, and so forth.
</p>

<h2>The 1995 FDRE Constitution</h2>
<p>
    The 1995 FDRE constitution is different from that of the Imperial and Derg constitutions. It made an important departure in the history of constitutional development in the country regarding its basic philosophy, content, and organization of government. The constitution strongly affirms and expresses that the nations, nationalities, and people of Ethiopia are the source of sovereignty. It explicitly states the rights and duties of the federal government as well as the prerogatives of the regional states.
</p>
<p>
    It also states that political power shall be held through free, fair, and periodic elections. It entitles Ethiopian citizens to exercise their human, democratic, political, and socio-economic rights and freedoms. It defines the rights of nations, nationalities, and peoples of Ethiopia to exercise their self-determination, including the right to secession (Article 39). The constitution recognizes and affirms fundamental human rights and freedoms in conformity with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and other international human rights instruments.
</p>
<p>
    The constitution established a federal state structure with nine member states (National Regional States) that exercise legislative, executive, and judicial powers in their own jurisdictions. It established a parliamentary system with three branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial powers performing different functions. It is a bicameral parliament (House of Peoples’ Representatives and the House of the Federation). The parliament has the power of legislation on matters relating to the federal government.
</p>
<p>
    The constitution provides the House of the Federation with the power to interpret the constitution. The Council of Constitutional Inquiry (CCI) is given the power to investigate constitutional disputes, assisting the House of Federation. An executive organ led by a Prime Minister, whose office is accountable to the House of Peoples Representatives (HPR), is set up.
</p>
<p>
    The executive branch includes the President, Prime Minister, Council of State, and Council of Ministers. The president is elected by both legislative chambers for a six-year term. The leader of the largest party in the lower chamber becomes Prime Minister, who submits cabinet ministers for the chamber’s approval. All ministers serve for the duration of the legislative session. Executive power is in the hands of the Prime Minister, who is also the commander in chief of the armed forces. An independent judiciary with the supreme federal judicial authority vested in the Federal Supreme Court is established. Regions have the State Council (with legislative power), State administration (the highest organ of state executive), and judicial power vested in courts. The judicial branch is composed of federal and state courts.
</p>
<p>
    The Federal Supreme Court is the highest court and exercises jurisdiction over all federal matters. The president and vice president of the Federal Supreme Court are recommended by the Prime Minister and approved by the lower chamber of the legislature.
</p>

<h1>Stages in the ratification of the FDRE Constitution</h1>

<h2>Drafting Stage</h2>
<p>
    The drafting stage was the first stage of the formulation of the 1995 FDRE Constitution. A special body known as the Constituent Assembly carried out the drafting task. Experts with a good deal of experience from other countries were invited to seminars and workshops that helped immensely in sharing experiences.
</p>

<h2>Discussions and Development Stage</h2>
<p>
    This stage involved extensive public discussions on the draft of the constitution, which can be termed as a popular discussion of the constitution. These extensive discussions on the draft gave citizens of Ethiopia the opportunity to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Know the tentative provisions that would be part of the final constitution,</li>
    <li>Amend or improve the provisions before they were enforced into action, and</li>
    <li>Participate in the formulation of their own constitution.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Ratification Stage</h2>
<p>
    This stage is also known as adoption or endorsement. The Constitutional Assembly—a special body constituted of elected representatives of the Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples of Ethiopia—accomplished the historical task of ratifying or endorsing the draft of the constitution. In the Constitutional Assembly, 538 elected citizens participated. The Assembly thoroughly and conspicuously discussed the draft of the constitution for three weeks. Each provision or article of the draft was passed by vote. Finally, the signatures of the Constitutional Assembly endorsed it on December 8, 1994, and it came into force on the 21st day of August, 1995.
</p>

<h1>Objectives of the 1995 FDRE Constitution</h1>
<p>
    The preamble, which is an introduction to the main body of the constitution, determines the objectives and principles that the Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples of Ethiopia share in common:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Building a political community based on the popular will or agreement that is the destiny of all Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples of Ethiopia;</li>
    <li>To have the rule of law as the foundation of the political community built based on popular will;</li>
    <li>Ensuring lasting peace, democracy, and development that would characterize building a prosperous country;</li>
    <li>Maintaining and consolidating the effectiveness and successful unity based on diversity through guaranteeing and securing the right of Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples of Ethiopia to self-determination, including up to secession.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Fundamental Principles of the FDRE Constitution</h1>
<p>
    <strong>Sovereignty of the People:</strong> It indicates that power is vested in the hands of the people. As stated in Article 8, “All sovereign power resides in the nations, nationalities, and peoples of Ethiopia.” Hence, citizens are legally recognized as the ultimate sources of political power.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Supremacy of the Constitution:</strong> According to Article 9 (1) of the constitution, “the constitution is the supreme law of the land… Any law that contradicts the constitution has no legal effect.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Separation of State and Religion (Secularism):</strong> In the long history of Ethiopia, state and religion were inseparable entities. However, today, according to Article 11 of the FDRE constitution, state and religion are separate, and there is no state religion. Religion shall not interfere in state affairs, and likewise, the state shall not interfere in religious affairs.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Respect for Human and Democratic Rights:</strong> Human and democratic rights in current Ethiopia have legal protections, as stated in Articles 14-44 of the FDRE constitution.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Accountability of Government:</strong> This principle is recognized in Article 12 (1) and (2) of the FDRE constitution. It denotes that the government should be responsible for its functions. The conduct of government affairs shall be transparent, and any public official or elected representative is accountable for any failure in their duties.

    <h2>Defining Democracy</h2>
    <p>In our contemporary world, democracy as a way of life is the most advocated system of government. It is conceived as the institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide based on competitive struggle for the people’s vote. Democracy as a way of life concerns social justice, civil and political rights, gender equality, etc., in the process of interactions between citizens themselves and between the government and citizens.</p>
    <p>Democracy implies the existence of ethical values in an enabling environment such as freedom, human rights, organized dialogues, and the exercise of citizenship.</p>
    <p>Etymologically, the term democracy is derived from classical Greek <em>democratia</em>, which means rule by the people. It is formed from the two roots <em>demos</em> (by the people) and <em>kratos</em> (rule). Hence, the word democracy literally means rule by the people.</p>
    <p>The competition for political leadership is the distinctive feature of democracy. Democracy is a complex and elusive concept: there is no universally agreed definition of democracy among politicians and researchers. Different people define democracy in different ways.</p>
    <p><strong>Shumpeter</strong> defined democracy as a system for arriving at political decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of competitive struggle for the people’s vote.</p>
    <p><strong>Przeworski</strong> also defined democracy as a regime in which governmental offices are filled as a consequence of contested election.</p>
    <p>According to <strong>Abraham Lincoln</strong>, democracy is defined as the government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Accordingly, democracy is a system of government and also a society where liberty, justice, and respect for human rights prevail.</p>

                        <div style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; margin: 20px;">
    <h2>Forms of Democracy</h2>
    <p>There are two basic forms of democracy: direct democracy and representative democracy.</p>
    
    <h3>Direct (Pure) Democracy</h3>
    <p>Direct democracy is a political system where all citizens can participate in making public decisions personally, without relying on intermediaries or representative officials. Direct democracy is obviously practical only with relatively small numbers of people – in a community organization, where members can meet in a single room to discuss issues and arrive at decisions by consensus or majority vote. Modern society, with its large size and complexity, offers few opportunities for direct democracy.</p>

    <h3>Representative (Indirect) Democracy</h3>
    <p>Today, the most common form of democracy is representative democracy, which involves the selection of government officials by the people being represented. In representative democracy, citizens elect their representatives to make political decisions, formulate laws, and administer programs on their behalf. It can be true representative democracy if and only if the representatives are elected through a democratic election.</p>

    <h3>Approaches of Understanding Democracy</h3>
    <p>There are two views of understanding democracy: substantive and procedural views.</p>

    <h4>Substantive Views of Democracy</h4>
    <p>The substantive view concentrates on what a government actually does, that is, the policies it makes should fulfill democratic ideals. A substantive theorist would not recognize a decision that violated those ideals as "democratic" even if it were made in response to majority wishes. Substantive democracy is a form of democracy in which the outcome of elections is representative of the people. Substantive democracy functions in the interest of the governed. Though a country may allow all citizens of age to vote, this characteristic does not necessarily qualify it as a substantive democracy. This type of democracy can also be referred to as a functional democracy.</p>

    <h4>Procedural Views of Democracy</h4>
    <p>The procedural view stresses the form and process of government, or how the government governs. Procedural democracy emphasizes the principles of universal participation, political equality, and majority rule. The procedural view of democracy also insists on the principle of responsiveness, that the government should follow the general thrust of public opinion.</p>
    <p>The procedural view of democracy sets forth principles that describe how government should make decisions and address three distinct questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Who should participate in decision-making?</li>
        <li>How much should each participant's vote count?</li>
        <li>How many votes are needed to reach decisions?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This type of democracy is characterized by voters choosing to elect representatives in free elections. Procedural democracy assumes that the electoral process is at the core of the authority placed in elected officials and ensures that all procedures of elections are properly complied with. It could be described as a democracy in which only the basic structures and institutions are in place. Commonly, the previously elected representatives use electoral procedures to maintain themselves in power against the common wish of the people, thus awkwardly establishing a full-fledged democracy.</p>

                       <div style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; margin: 20px;">
    <h2>Actors in the Democratization Process</h2>
    <p>Modern democracy has procreated the system of political parties, organized interest groups, and an independent media as indispensable factors for its operation among others. The fact behind this is that the representative system arranges the mobilization of political participation by enjoying upon the members of politically active people to take the mass, as much as possible in confidence either for the sake of demonstrating their faith or to justify the very legitimacy of their leadership and authority.</p>
    
    <p>Building up of democracy is not an overnight program; as a process, it needs not only time but different actors must also be involved to build democracy and democratic culture. The following are the major actors:</p>
    
    <h3>1. Political Parties</h3>
    <p>In a political regime characterized by representative democracy, political parties are vectors of democracy. They are essential to the functioning and durability of democracy since they are not only the instruments through which power is attained by means of free, fair, and transparent elections but also the setting for working out practical ideas and proposals which may constitute alternative programs to the government. They also constitute the means through which individuals may influence public affairs, express their discontent, or support governmental action.</p>
    
    <p>Open competition between political parties in the framework of elections is one of the indispensable characteristics of representative democracies. Open competition between parties contending for the management of a country's affairs is a socially and politically divisive factor, and the stakes are generally high for those involved in this competition. It is important, and this is one of the conditions for democracy's survival.</p>
    
    <h3>Party Systems</h3>
    <p>Party systems refer to the number of parties and the pattern of relationships among the parties within a nation. Taking into account the number of dominant or existing political parties within a state, party systems are classified into four major categories:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>a. One Party System</li>
        <li>b. Two Party System</li>
        <li>c. Dominant (One) Party System</li>
        <li>d. Multi Party System</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>One Party System</h4>
    <p>One party system is, most of the time, ideological in its outlook and authoritarian in its structure. In this system, it is usually not allowed for other parties to exist and function. As such, the party and its ideology are the main determinants of governmental policy, style, and the very existence of the media and interest groups and the like. In this case, the party requires that important government officials are members of the party or of satellite groups and expects their behavior to conform to the policies and ideology of the state or the ruling party.</p>
    
    <h4>Two Party System</h4>
    <p>Two party systems are characterized by a regular alternation in office between two major dominant parties. In two party systems, although minor parties exist, two major parties dominate government power. It is argued that the system provides the people with a choice of policies and leaders while at the same time guaranteeing governmental stability. The devices of the electoral arrangement in such a system assure a majority for one party or the other, thus enabling that one will have the power to carry out its election promises. The United States of America and Britain are examples of this system.</p>
    
    <h4>Dominant (One) Party System</h4>
    <p>Dominant party system is competitive in the sense that a number of parties compete for power in regular popular elections but is dominated by a single major party that consequently enjoys prolonged periods in power. Dominant party system is characterized by weak and ineffective oppositions.</p>
    
    <h4>Multi Party System</h4>
    <p>Multiparty systems are systems in which we have at least three or more major parties. In a multiparty system, one party rarely wins enough seats in the legislature to form a government. Several parties combine forces to obtain a majority and form a coalition government to direct the nation’s affairs. Coalition governments established by multiple party systems are often fragile and unstable. Example: Israel.</p>

    <h3>Interest Groups</h3>
    <p>Interest groups are associations on the basis of the free will of individuals. Consistent with the freedom of association granted to citizens in democracies, democratic states are characterized by the emergence and operation of several kinds of interest groups. Interest groups are organizations or groups of people, which are autonomous from government or political parties, with the objective of influencing government. In democracies, we find several interest groups who are attempting to promote and influence the policies of government. Interest groups are regarded as essential transmission belts between people and government.</p>
    
    <h3>Public Opinion</h3>
    <p>Public opinion is made up of citizens or specific groups that reflect on their community and express their criticisms, proposals, or agreement to influence the construction of political will. It is not possible to talk about only one public opinion, but several, because in a plural society, there are always several stands. Public opinion is then a tool to control the politicians that lead the country. On the one hand, this is important for the opposition, as the latter is only potentially active in front of the government through this public opinion.</p>
    
    <h3>Mass Media</h3>
    <p>The mass media refers to institutions and methods of communication which can reach a large number of people at the same time. It includes newspapers, television, radio, books, posters, magazines, and cinema, etc. Media plays a role in the political training of citizens and democratic culture by informing them of the scope of public policies, the management and conduct of affairs by those responsible at both the state and grass-roots levels, and by providing and offering the members of the community the means of communicating with each other. If the media is to perform those functions, it must be free and independent; it must have sufficient material and human resources to deal with all the important problems of society. The importance of the mass media in a country is not dependent on the number of newspapers or private radio and television stations, but on the quality of the information provided to the public.</p>

    <h2>Principles and Values of Democracy</h2>
    <p>Whether a given political system is democratic or undemocratic, it could be measured in terms of the major principles of democracy and their practice. The mere inclusion of the major democratic principles in a constitution does not necessarily make a given government or state democratic; it is the level of implementation or practice of these principles that makes a government democratic or undemocratic.</p>
    
    <p>There are a number of principles and values of democracy. Some of them are the following:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Popular Sovereignty:</strong> The principle that the authority of a government is created and sustained by the consent of its people, typically through their elected representatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Free, Fair and Periodic Elections:</strong> Elections must be held regularly, must be open to all eligible citizens, and must be conducted in a manner that is transparent and just.</li>
        <li><strong>Majority Rule and Minority Rights:</strong> While the majority's decision should be respected, the rights of minority groups must also be protected to prevent tyranny of the majority.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-party System:</strong> A political system in which multiple political parties compete for power, allowing for a wider representation of views and interests in governance.</li>
        <li><strong>Human and Democratic Rights:</strong> The recognition and protection of fundamental rights and freedoms for all individuals, including civil liberties and political rights.</li>
        <li><strong>The Rule of Law:</strong> The principle that all individuals and institutions are accountable to the law, which is fairly applied and enforced, ensuring justice and equality.</li>
        <li><strong>Equality Before the Law:</strong> The principle that every individual is treated equally under the law, without discrimination based on race, gender, religion, or other status.</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability and Transparency:</strong> Government officials must be answerable for their actions, and the decision-making processes should be open and accessible to the public.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Human Rights</h1>
    <p>
        Human rights are those basic freedoms and rights that belong to every individual or people purely by virtue of their being human beings. 
        To be free from fear, deprivation and to have the opportunity to achieve all that we deserve and are capable of is a basic human aspiration. 
        Human rights constitute sometimes called natural rights. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Human rights can also be defined as those basic standards without which people cannot live in dignity as human beings. 
        Human rights are the foundation of freedom, justice and peace, the existence of which allows the individual and the community to fully develop.
    </p>
    <p>
        Human rights are universal, inalienable, and indivisible and interrelated. Human rights are universal that shall be enjoyed by all human beings regardless of their sex, age, race, class, language, national origin, or political beliefs. 
        We are all born free and equal, in dignity and rights. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Human rights are also called universal because their core ideas are common to all major religions, faiths, moral codes and cross-national and cultural boundaries. 
        Another reason for their being universal is that they belong not only to individuals but also to communities. For example, a community of tribal people has the right to speak its own language and preserve its way of life, provided these do not violate the human rights of their individuals or groups.
    </p>
    <p>
        Human rights are inalienable that cannot be taken away; no one has the right to legitimately deprive another person of these rights for any reason.
        People have human rights even when the laws of their countries do not recognize them, or when they violate them. For example, when slavery was practiced, slaves still had human rights even though these rights were being violated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Human rights are indivisible & interrelated. This means that all the rights together form a set that cannot be divided into smaller groups of rights. 
        To live in dignity, all human beings are entailed to freedom, security and decent standards of living concurrently. 
        Though they are called by different names and sometimes separated into different categories, every right depends on another for its fulfillment. 
        No right can really be put into practice without other rights. 
        For example, the right to education is classified as a social right but it would not be possible for all people to get that right if there was no right to equality, or if there was no court to uphold that right.

    <h1>Categories of Human Rights</h1>
    <p>
        Though human rights are indivisible and interrelated, they are often put into different categories for better understanding of the characteristics and significance of each right in relation with others. 
        There are various classifications of human rights; but commonly human rights are classified into three broad categories: 
    </p>
    <h2>Civil and Political Rights (First Generation Rights)</h2>
    <p>
        These are liberty-oriented rights that include the rights to life, liberty and security of the individual; freedom from torture and slavery; political participation; freedom of opinion, expression, thought, conscience and religion; freedom of association and assembly.
    </p>
    <h2>Economic and Social Rights (Second Generation Rights)</h2>
    <p>
        These are security-oriented rights that concern the production, development, and management of material for the necessities of life. 
        Rights that give people social and economic security include the rights to work, education, a reasonable standard of living, food, shelter, and health care.
    </p>
    <h2>Environmental, Cultural and Developmental Rights (Third Generation Rights)</h2>
    <p>
        These include the right to live in an environment that is clean and protected from destruction, and rights to cultural, political and economic development. 
        These rights are sometimes also called solidarity or development rights, as they focus on peace, a more equitable socio-economic order, solidarity, and a sustainable environment.

    <h1>History of Human Rights</h1>
    <p>
        The basis of human rights—such as respect for human life and human dignity—is a value as old as humanity that can be found in most religions and philosophies. 
        The concept of human rights, which is an ethical concept, has developed throughout history as a result of negative conditions that befell humanity, such as World War II. 
        The emergence of this concept as an ethical value, which embodies human dignity, can be traced in the history of all world religions, serving as the basis that guides human relations among individuals, communities, and groups. 
        This value has developed because it is related to fundamental human needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The development of human rights has its roots in the human needs and struggle for freedom and equality everywhere in the world. 
        The belief that everyone, by virtue of her or his humanity, is entitled to certain rights and freedoms is fairly new. Its roots, however, lie in earlier traditions and documents of many cultures. 
        Throughout much of history, people acquired rights and responsibilities through their membership in a group—a family, nation, religion, class, community, or state. 
        Though human rights were codified in the twentieth century, human rights values are rooted in religious teachings, traditional values, and wisdom literature of most cultures. 
        Most societies have traditions, whether in oral or written form, that address questions of people’s duties and rights. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, the Bible, the Koran, the Hindu Vedas, the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, and the Analects of Confucius are five of the oldest written sources that served as standards of proper behavior (morally and socially acceptable), systems of justice, and ways of ensuring the health and well-being of their societies. 
        Many charters and bills asserting individual rights had also been enacted long before the twentieth century. 
        Some examples of such written documents (precursors to today’s human rights documents) include the Charter of Magna Carta (1215), the English Bill of Rights (1689), the French Declaration on the Rights of Man and Citizen (1789), and the US Constitution and Bill of Rights (1791).
    </p>
    <p>
        The contemporary idea of human rights, however, emerged stronger after the horrible experiences of World War II. 
        The extermination by Nazi Germany of over six million Jews, Sinti and Romani (Gypsies), homosexuals, and persons with disabilities horrified the world. 
        After the war, trials of Nazi officials from the defeated countries were held in Nuremberg and Tokyo, resulting in their punishment for committing war crimes, crimes against peace, and crimes against humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Subsequently, governments committed themselves to establishing the United Nations, with the primary goal of promoting international peace and preventing conflict. 
        There was a common desire then to ensure that never again would anyone be unjustly denied life, freedom, food, shelter, and nationality. 
        The global call for human rights standards to protect citizens from abuses by their governments, standards against which nations could be held accountable for the treatment of those living within their borders, eventually led to the emergence of the United Nations Charter. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Adopted by 50 of the 51 original member countries on 26 June 1945 and entering into force on 24 October 1945 in San Francisco (U.S.A), the United Nations Charter is an initial document that forms and establishes the international organization called the United Nations, setting forth its goals, functions, and responsibilities. 
        The charter states that one of the aims of the UN is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.
    </p>
    <p>
        The UN Commission on Human Rights was established and charged with creating an International Bill of Human Rights. 
        The International Bill of Human Rights consists of:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)</li>
        <li>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)</li>
        <li>The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)</li>
    </ul>

                        <div>
    <h1>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights</h1>
    <p>
        The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, which consisted of 56 member countries including Ethiopia, on December 10, 1948. 
        The UDHR, the first international human rights instrument, serves to define the basic human rights and freedoms to which all individuals are entitled. 
        It is the most widely accepted statement of human rights in the world, a statement of principles to base a new world order so that all the death, destruction, and sufferings that took place in the two world wars would never happen again. 
        The core idea of the UDHR is the inherent value of every human being.
    </p>
    <p>
        The UDHR sets out a list of basic rights for everyone in the world, regardless of their race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, class, or other status. 
        It states that governments have promised to uphold certain rights, not only for their own citizens but also for people in other countries. 
        In other words, national borders are not barriers to help others achieve their rights.
    </p>
    <p>
        The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) reiterates some of the rights specified in the UDHR. 
        It articulates the specific, liberty-oriented rights that a state may not take from its citizens, such as freedom of expression, freedom of religion, freedom of movement, and the rights to life and liberty. 
        These include the rights to self-determination, being free from discrimination, equality of men and women in the enjoyment of civil and political rights, and the rights to equality before the law.
    </p>
    <p>
        The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) addresses those provisions in the UDHR that define an individual’s rights to basic necessities, such as food, housing, education, and health care, which a state should provide for its citizens insofar as it is able. 
        The inherent dignity of the human person, equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family are the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world, including the right to self-determination, the right to use and dispose of natural wealth and resources, and men and women being equally entitled to the enjoyment of all economic, social, and cultural rights.

    <h1>Subsequent Human Rights Documents</h1>
    <p>
        In addition to the covenants in the International Bill of Human Rights, the United Nations has adopted more than 20 principal treaties further elaborating human rights. 
        These include conventions to prevent and prohibit specific abuses like torture and genocide and to protect especially vulnerable populations, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (1951)</li>
        <li>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (1979)</li>
        <li>Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In Europe, the Americas, and Africa, regional documents for the protection and promotion of human rights extend the International Bill of Human Rights, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (1981)</li>
        <li>The Cairo Declaration on Human Rights (1990)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The dramatic changes in Eastern Europe, Africa, and Latin America since 1989 have powerfully demonstrated a surge in demand for respect for human rights. 
        The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights contains most of the rights in the UDHR and ICCPR. 
        It also includes the rights to equality of all peoples and the duties of individuals, such as respect for the family and individuals, protecting the family and the country. 
        Almost all of the rights provided in the UDHR are also enumerated in the constitutions of many African countries, such as Ethiopia, South Africa, and Uganda.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite the ratification of most international and regional treaties, the state of human rights protection is poor in most African countries. 
        The rights to property, the right to a speedy and fair trial, the right to privacy, the right to free expression, the right to work, and the right to education and health services are often violated. 
        Some prisoners are tortured or ill-treated; discrimination and domestic violence also prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
        The major causes for the violation of rights and abuses include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Poverty</li>
        <li>Bad governance</li>
        <li>Monopoly of power by certain groups</li>
        <li>Ethnic and religious diversity and misunderstandings</li>
        <li>Ignorance of rights and responsibilities</li>
        <li>Corruption</li>
        <li>Mal-distribution of resources (political and administrative positions, land, money)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Some of the conditions often considered as constituting violations of human rights by African states are the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Failing to take steps stated in the constitution and in international and regional instruments.</li>
        <li>Failing to remove obstacles to the fulfillment of rights.</li>
        <li>Willfully failing to meet generally accepted international minimum standards for the treatment of people.</li>
        <li>Applying limitations to the rights recognized in various human rights documents.</li>
        <li>Deliberately retarding or halting the progressive realization of the rights.</li>
        <li>The government itself committing various violations of rights.</li>
        <li>Failing to protect the rights of others from violation by community members, organizations, employers, or others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The task of promoting and protecting human rights and thereby preventing human rights violations in Africa, like anywhere else, is a formidable challenge. 
        Education is considered the basic and crucial tool for the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
        Education must be directed toward strengthening respect for human rights, the full development of human personality and the sense of its dignity, and the promotion of understanding, tolerance, gender equality, and friendship among all nations, indigenous people, racial, ethnic, and religious groups.

    <h1>Universality/Relativity of Human Rights</h1>
    <p>
        Some debates exist regarding the universality or relativity of the international human rights standards and the instruments ratified by most countries of the world.
        With the growing concerns for human rights in the international community and the development of international law in the field, many people have regarded that human rights are universal in nature and the same for all people regardless of their race, language, culture, or country of origin.
    </p>
    <p>
        In recent decades, especially among Asian countries such as China and Singapore, it has been argued that human rights are relative rather than universal, and that the traditional concept of human rights, which places emphasis on political and civil rights, must be adapted to such emerging concepts as the right to development. 
        These scholars argue that the human rights standards are based on Western (American and European) cultures, rather than on universal values, and thus are not fully applicable to countries in other continents, such as Africa and Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
        The controversy over the universality and relativity of human rights seems to have developed into a contention between the West and the East. 
        While many Western nations support the former notion, many Asian countries argue for the latter. 
        However, neither of the two arguments seems flawless and/or pointless.
    </p>
    <h2>The Universality of Human Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Arguments for and by proponents of the universality of human rights are mainly based on at least one major premise: that human rights are inherent in human beings and human values, and therefore are universal in nature.
        Accordingly, the concept of human rights is made up of various intrinsic human values that are interrelated and interdependent. 
        These values need to be looked at in a holistic manner so as to have a complete understanding of their meaning and their intended end result—the well-being of human society.
    </p>
    <p>
        A large number of advocates of human rights regard economic equity, quality of opportunity, democratic participation, and freedom of person, sustaining and sustainable environment, responsibility, and accountability as forming the central values of human rights.
    </p>
    <p>
        Human rights are in principle based on the philosophy of humanism. 
        Humanism is a broad category of ethical philosophy that affirms the dignity and worth of all people, based on the ability to determine right and wrong by appeal to universal human qualities—particularly rationality or the ability to reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        Humanism entails a commitment to the search for truth and morality through human means in support of human interests and rights. 
        Humanists endorse universal morality based on the commonality of the human condition, suggesting that solutions to human social and cultural problems cannot be localized or limited to a certain country or people.
    </p>
    <h2>The Relativity of Human Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Proponents of the relativity theory of human rights argue that from the empirical study of human history, as well as the contemporary world, human rights are relative as they are not held and guaranteed in all places and at all times. 
        It was argued that human rights are relative because human beings are constrained within limits of their own existence, which could be in terms of culture, religion, economy, ethnicity, class, and so on. 
        These values must be respected and it is not permissible to impose universal values upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The core human values will be universal in nature, but their development into practical principles for guidance of individual and collective life would necessarily be culture-specific. 
        Though the theoretical conflicts between a universal and relativist approach to human rights remain unresolved, the former has become codified in international agreements and seems to have won wider support.
    </p>
    <p>
        The latest consensus among the UN member states on the universality of human rights values, within the context of cultural diversity, was expressed in the 1993 Vienna Declaration on Human Rights. 
        Article 5 of the Declaration states that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent, and interrelated. 
        The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis. 
        While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural, and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, it is the duty of states, regardless of their political, economic, and cultural systems.
