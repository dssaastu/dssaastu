            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>This article examines the seminal work of the 20th-century Ethiopian philosopher Eguale Gebre Yohannes, የትምህርት አሠራር (The Style of Higher Education). Published at the dawn of Ethiopia's modern university system, the book addresses the cultural crisis stemming from the encounter between indigenous Ethiopian civilization and modern Western thought. The article analyzes Eguale's central thesis: a rejection of both uncritical imitation of the West and stagnant traditionalism in favor of a philosophy of “Tewahido” (synthesis). We explore his use of archetypes, the “Faustian" West versus the “Yaredic" Ethiopia, to frame the cultural dilemma. The core of the analysis focuses on his metaphor of grafting a "wild” branch of Western knowledge onto the "cultivated" rootstock of Ethiopian heritage. Furthermore, the article looks into Eguale's humanistic educational aims, which prioritize the cultivation of a virtuous and self-aware “whole person” over purely utilitarian outcomes. The study concludes that Eguale's work provides a timeless philosophical blueprint for post-colonial education, offering a model for authentically integrating local identity with global knowledge.</p>

        <main>
            <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the mid-20th century, Ethiopia stood at a historical and cultural crossroads. The era, defined by Emperor Haile Selassie I's ambitious modernization projects, was one of immense national aspiration and deep-seated anxiety [1]. The capstone of this modernizing endeavor was the establishment of Ethiopia's first national university in 1950, chartered as Haile Selassie I University in 1961 [2]. This was far more than an educational milestone; it was an existential project aimed at forging the very soul of the modern Ethiopian. The nation faced a monumental challenge: how to embrace the undeniable power of Western science, technology, and pedagogy without sacrificing the ancient, deep-rooted civilization that had defined its identity for millennia [3]. This tension created a palpable cultural crisis, a moment of decision that would shape the country's intellectual and spiritual trajectory for generations to come.</p>
            <p>It was into this charged intellectual environment that Eguale Gebre Yohannes (1909-1976) emerged as a pivotal philosophical voice. A distinguished intellectual and philosopher, Eguale was uniquely positioned to mediate this critical cultural dialogue [4]. Educated in both the rich traditions of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and the secular philosophical academies of Europe, he possessed the rare ability to think and articulate the national dilemma from within both worlds. His seminal work, የትምህርት አሠራር (The Style of Higher Education), was not a detached academic treatise but a direct, passionate intervention into this national debate [5]. Born from a series of radio addresses, the book is a masterclass in public philosophy, a deliberate attempt to guide the nation through its complex transition by grounding its future in a coherent and authentic philosophical framework.</p>
            <p>The intellectual climate into which Eguale intervened was deeply polarized. On one side were the traditionalists, primarily scholars from the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, who viewed the influx of Western education with suspicion. For them, this new pedagogy, rooted in secularism and empiricism, threatened to erode the nation's ancient faith, which they saw as the very bedrock of its identity and moral order. On the other side was a burgeoning class of Western-educated Ethiopians, often referred to as the "Japanizers," who were fervent advocates for rapid modernization. Many in this group saw tradition as an obstacle, a relic of a bygone era that needed to be cleared away to make room for progress. This created a stark binary: a choice between a past perceived as sacred but static, and a future perceived as prosperous but foreign. Eguale's unique intellectual formation made him the ideal mediator for this conflict. His grounding in the rigorous exegetical and philosophical traditions of the Ethiopian church gave him deep respect for the nation's heritage, while his European education provided him with the philosophical language and critical tools to engage with and deconstruct Western thought on its own terms. He was not merely a synthesizer; he was a bridge, uniquely capable of holding both worlds in a single, coherent vision.</p>
            <p>The central problem that Eguale diagnoses with striking clarity is what he terms a “kultur-krise”, a crisis of culture and the very “flavor of life” (የጣዕመ ሕይወት ችግር). He saw his contemporaries being pulled between two perilous extremes, a dilemma common in post-colonial contexts [6]. On one side was the path of uncritical imitation, a wholesale adoption of Western educational models that threatened to turn Ethiopia into a mere cultural appendage of Europe [7]. On the other was the danger of a stagnant, reactionary traditionalism, a retreat into a glorified past that was no longer equipped to address the complexities of the modern world. For Eguale, neither path was tenable. The challenge was not to choose between tradition and modernity, but to forge a third way, a path of creative synthesis [5].</p>
            <p>This article argues that Eguale Gebre Yohannes, in የትምህርት አሠራር, rejects both blind imitation of the West and stagnant traditionalism, proposing instead a philosophy of 'Tewahido' (synthesis) where modern education is grafted onto the deep-rooted stock of Ethiopian civilization to create a new, vibrant, and authentic intellectual tradition. He does not advocate for a simple mixing of disparate elements, but for an organic, symbiotic relationship where the ancient roots of Ethiopian identity provide the essential nourishment for the new branches of modern knowledge. This vision is not merely about curriculum design; it is a philosophical statement about national identity, cultural continuity, and the ultimate purpose of education [8].</p>
            <p>Eguale's solution of “Tewahido” is most powerfully articulated through an adaptation of a Pauline metaphor: the grafting of a wild olive branch onto a cultivated olive tree [?, cf. Bible 2011]. In this analogy, the ancient, cultivated, and life-giving tree is Ethiopian civilization. The “wild branch” represents the potent knowledge of the West. In the chapter “በተዋሕዶ ይከብራል” (“It is Honored Through Synthesis"), he makes this relationship explicit:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p class="ethiopic">ወለእመ ፡ ተሰብሩ አዕጹቂሃ ኪያከ አውልዓ ገዳም ተከሉ መካኖሙ | ወኀበርከ ሥርወ ምስሌሆሙ፤ ወኮንከ ዘይተ ከማሆሙ ፤ ፍሩሐከ ንበር ፤ ወኢትዜኀር ላዕለ አዕፁቅ ፤ እስመ አኮ አንተ ዘትፀውሮ ለሥርው አላ ሥርው ይፀውረከ።</p>
                <p class="translation">(And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive shoot, were grafted in their place... remain in reverence; and do not be haughty... for it is not you who supports the root, but the root that supports you.) [5]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This assertion, that the root supports the branch, is the cornerstone of Eguale's educational philosophy. It is a powerful rebuke to those who believed that Ethiopia's past was a liability [1]. For Eguale, this heritage was the very source of life upon which any sustainable modernity could be built. The following sections will examine this thesis in detail, analyzing the cultural dichotomy Eguale establishes between the “Faustian” West and the “Yaredic” Ethiopia, his philosophy of “Tewahido,” and his vision for a humanistic curriculum modeled on the Platonic Academy [9]. Ultimately, this article will argue for the enduring relevance of Eguale's work as a philosophical blueprint for navigating the complex relationship between local identity and global knowledge.</p>

            <h2>2 The Philosophical Conflict: "Faustian” West vs. “Yaredic” Ethiopia</h2>
            <p>Before offering a prescription, Eguale undertakes a deep philosophical diagnosis of the two civilizations at Ethiopia's gates. He understood the encounter with the West was a collision of two distinct Weltanschauungen, or worldviews [3]. To articulate their essence, he employs potent archetypes. For the West, he chooses Faust, the insatiable scholar of German legend [10]. For Ethiopia, he elevates Saint Yared, the divinely inspired father of its sacred intellectual tradition [11].</p>
            
            <h3>2.1 The "Faustian” Spirit: An Insatiable Quest for Human Mastery</h3>
            <p>In the chapter “የአውሮፓ መንፈስ” (“The European Spirit"), Eguale characterizes modern Western civilization as “Faustian” (ፋውስጣዊ). Dr. Faustus, who sells his soul for infinite power and experience, becomes a metaphor for the West's post-Renaissance intellectual orientation [10]. This spirit is defined by a relentless, unquenchable thirst for knowledge that recognizes no sacred boundaries and an ambition that seeks to place humanity at the center of its own universe. The Faustian journey begins with a dissatisfaction, which Eguale captures by paraphrasing Goethe's famous monologue:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p class="ethiopic">እዬ ፍልስፍና ሕግ ወይም ሕክምና ፤ ያሳዝናል ከቴ ደግሞ ታኦሎጊም... ተማርኩ በሚያቃጥል ድካም ፤ እንዲህ ሆኜ ቀረሁ አንድ ምስኪን ደንቆሮ... ጥልቅ ዕውቀት ለማግኘት ሲሳነኝ ማየቴ ምንም አልተረፈ ተቃጠለ አንጀቴ።</p>
                <p class="translation">(Alas, I have studied philosophy, law, medicine, and sadly, theology... with arduous toil; and here I am, a poor fool... Seeing my failure to attain deep knowledge, nothing remains for me but a burning gut.) [5]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This burning dissatisfaction is the engine of the Faustian spirit. Its drive is inherently anthropocentric. Knowledge is not sought to understand a divine plan, but to empower humanity, to make man the master of his own destiny [12]. The ultimate aim of this spirit was “ካለው የሰው አእምሮ ድንበር አልፎ ለመሄድ” (“to go beyond the existing border of the human mind") [5]. This relentless drive yielded extraordinary results, from the scientific revolution to the industrial age [13]. However, Eguale recognizes the inherent peril. By placing man as the sole “measure of all things,” echoing Protagoras, it creates a world of immense material achievement but potential spiritual desolation. This relentless forward momentum is both the glory and the tragedy of the West in Eguale's analysis.</p>

            <h3>2.2 The "Yaredic" Spirit: Knowledge as Divine Revelation</h3>
            <p>As a counterpoint, Eguale presents the "Yaredic” (ያሬዳዊ) spirit of Ethiopian civilization, embodied in Saint Yared. This worldview is fundamentally theocentric [14]. Saint Yared, the 6th-century composer, traditionally received his wisdom not through human struggle but as a divine gift [11]. This origin story is key to understanding the Ethiopian intellectual tradition. Yaredic knowledge is received through humility and faith, a sacred inheritance. In the chapter “ያሬድ ወይስ ስለ ኢትዮጵያ ሥልጣኔ” (“Yared or On the Civilization of Ethiopia"), he establishes this difference:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p class="ethiopic">በአውሮፓ ሥልጣኔ መካከል ላይ የሚገኘው ሰው ነው ። ... በዚህ አንጻር የሀገራችንን ሥልጣኔ theocentric ብሎ ለመጥራት ይቻላል ። የማናቸውም ነገር ማዕከል... እግዚአብሔር ነው።</p>
                <p class="translation">(At the center of European civilization is man... In contrast, it is possible to call our country's civilization theocentric. The center of everything... is God.) [5]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In the Yaredic worldview, all facets of life are integrated under a single spiritual framework. Knowledge is not compartmentalized. The sacred music of Saint Yared is the ultimate expression of this integration, aligning human life with the rhythms of creation and celestial worship [11]. Under this theocentric framework, the purpose of knowledge is not to control nature, but to cultivate wisdom and virtue in the human soul, a concept central to classical philosophy as well [9]. The ultimate measure of all things is not man, but God. This worldview provided Ethiopia with its enduring strength: a sense of unity and cultural cohesion [3]. By establishing these archetypes, Eguale masterfully frames the central dilemma. The Faustian drive is world-shaping; the Yaredic foundation is soul-preserving. The critical question is how these spirits can be brought into a productive synthesis.</p>

            <h2>3 The Proposed Solution: The Philosophy of “Tewahido” (Synthesis)</h2>
            <p>Having framed the central conflict, Eguale moves from diagnosis to prescription. He proposes a sophisticated "third way," a philosophy of creative and organic synthesis encapsulated in the term “Tewahido” (ተዋሕዶ). By invoking "Tewahido,” Eguale is deliberately tapping into one of the deepest and most sophisticated concepts in Ethiopian thought. The theological doctrine of Tewahido, which defines the union of Christ's two natures, was forged through centuries of intense philosophical and theological debate [15]. It posits a union that is perfect and inseparable, yet which preserves the distinct integrity of each nature "without confusion, without change, without division, without separation." This is the key to Eguale's cultural philosophy. He is not advocating for a syncretic “mishmash” where both Ethiopian and Western traditions are watered down into a bland, indistinct hybrid. Rather, he is calling for a synthesis where both retain their essential character. Modern science should remain rigorously scientific; Ethiopian ethical and spiritual values should remain themselves. The “union” occurs within the mind and soul of the educated Ethiopian, who learns to think with the critical tools of the West while seeing and judging the world through the ethical lens of their own heritage. This is a far more demanding and sophisticated task than simply adding a few Ethiopian history courses to a Western curriculum; it is a call for a fundamental re-imagining of how knowledge is integrated and given meaning.</p>

            <h2>4 The True Aim of Education: Humanism over Utilitarianism</h2>
            <p>Having established the “Tewahido" principle, Eguale asks the most fundamental question: What is the ultimate purpose of this educational system? In “የትምህርት ዓላማ” (“The Aim of Education”), he articulates a humanistic vision, rooted in classical Socratic and Platonic traditions [18], which stands in stark opposition to a purely utilitarian approach. The primary aim is not to produce skilled technocrats, but to cultivate a “whole person” (ሙሉ ሰው). To frame this debate, Eguale draws upon the ancient conflict between the Platonists and the Sophists. The Sophists offered instruction for a fee, promising the practical skills necessary for success. Knowledge was a tool, its value measured by utility. Eguale fears Ethiopia might embrace this model, reducing learning to mere job training. He critiques this utilitarian view with a powerful analogy:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p class="ethiopic">ዕውቀት ለአንዱ ሁልጊዜ የሚያከብራት ወደላይ ወደ አርያም የምትመራው ሰማያዊት ነቢይት ናት ። ለሌላው ግን በወተትና በቅቤ የምታገለግለው አንድ ወፍራም ላም ናት ።</p>
                <p class="translation">(For one, knowledge is a heavenly prophetess who always ennobles and leads one upward... For the other, however, she is a fat cow that serves with milk and butter.) [5]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The utilitarian sees education as the "fat cow", a resource to be milked for material benefits. In contrast, the humanist, following Socrates and Plato, views knowledge as the “heavenly prophetess”, a sacred guide whose purpose is to elevate the soul [9]. An education system built around the “fat cow” model will ultimately fail the nation. For Eguale, the long-term dangers of a purely utilitarian education extend far beyond the individual to threaten the very fabric of the nation. An educational system that exclusively prioritizes technical skills and economic productivity risks creating a class of elites who are, in a sense, culturally and ethically unmoored. While they may be highly effective at their specific jobs, they may lack the historical consciousness, civic virtue, and deep sense of shared identity necessary to lead a nation. Such an education produces specialists, not citizens. In place of this utilitarian model, Eguale proposes a holistic framework built on three interconnected aims:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Humanistic Aim (ሰብአዊነት):</strong> The Foundation of Self-Knowledge. At the heart of his philosophy, this aim echoes the Socratic imperative “Know thyself." Eguale argues that the primary subject of study must be humanity itself.</li>
                <li><strong>The Professional Aim (ምክሊታዊነት):</strong> Cultivating Innate Talents. The second aim is derived from the Ge'ez word “ምክሊት,” referring to an innate gift or talent. Eguale rejects a one-size-fits-all approach, arguing that the educational system must help each student discover and cultivate their unique "meklit.”</li>
                <li><strong>The Scientific Aim (ሳይንሳዊነት):</strong> The Creative Pursuit of New Knowledge. The third aim ensures his vision is not static but dynamic. A university cannot be a mere museum of past knowledge; it must be a vibrant engine for its creation. This is where Eguale incorporates the positive aspects of the "Faustian" spirit.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>5 The Ideal Educator and Institution</h2>
            <p>A philosophy remains abstract without the right agents and environment. In “ትምህርትና ፍቅር” (“Education and Love”) and “የፕላቶን አካዳሚ” (“The Platonic Academy”), Eguale argues that the ideal educator is a true philosopher, a "lover of wisdom", and the ideal university is a sacred community.</p>

            <h3>5.1 The Teacher as Zarathustra: The Overflowing Soul</h3>
            <p>Eguale rejects any model that reduces the teacher to a mere functionary. The true teacher is a transformative figure. He draws a powerful analogy to Nietzsche's Zarathustra, the prophet-philosopher who retreats to a mountain for a decade of solitary contemplation before descending to share his wisdom [12]. This represents the dual life of the educator: the ascent for solitary accumulation of wisdom and the descent to teach as an act of overflowing love. This descent is not motivated by duty, but by an abundance that must be shared. This act of sharing is synonymous with love (ፍቅር). He states:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p class="ethiopic">እውነተኛው መምህር በፍቅር ስሜት የተጥለቀለቀ በመንፈሱዋም የሰከረ ነው</p>
                <p class="translation">(The true teacher is one who is inundated with the feeling of love and intoxicated by its spirit.) [5]</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>5.2 The University as the Academy: A Sacred Community</h3>
            <p>If the ideal teacher is a philosopher, the ideal institution must be where this love for wisdom can be collectively pursued. For this, Eguale turns to Plato's Academy. He argues that the modern university has a sacred duty to live up to the spirit of its namesake. For Eguale, the Platonic Academy represents the pinnacle of what a university can be. It was a community, not a bureaucracy, bound by a shared quest for truth, goodness, and beauty. Its purpose was holistic, not specialized. He describes this ideal institution as a sacred space for building the human spirit:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p class="ethiopic">በውስጥዋ ረቂቅ ሕሊና ወይም ዕውቀት ፤ ንጹሕ ልቡና ወይም ሠናይት ፤ ... ትክክለኛ የሰው መንፈስ የሚታነጽበት የተከበረ ቦታ ስለሆነ...</p>
                <p class="translation">(Because it is a revered place where the subtle mind or knowledge, the pure heart or virtue... the authentic human spirit is built...) [5]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This vision of the university as a “revered place” is the institutional embodiment of his entire philosophy. It is the environment where the "Tewahido” synthesis can occur and the humanistic aims of education can be realized.</p>

            <h2>6 Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In a nutshell, we have traced the arc of Eguale Gebre Yohannes's philosophical project. We began by dissecting his diagnosis of the collision between the “Faustian” West and the “Yaredic” Ethiopia. Faced with this encounter, he rejected imitation and isolation, proposing instead the principle of “Tewahido." He argued that modern knowledge could only thrive if grafted onto the ancient roots of Ethiopian civilization. Finally, we explored how this principle shaped his humanistic vision for education, designed to cultivate a "whole person” rather than a mere utilitarian.</p>
            <p>የትምህርት አሠራር stands as a comprehensive philosophical blueprint for an authentic Ethiopian modernity. Eguale's work is a masterful act of intellectual mediation, a “third way” that seeks to build a future that is neither a replica of the West nor a museum of the past. The philosophy of “Tewahido” is a bold call for a modernity that is chosen, shaped, and owned.</p>
            <p>The enduring power of Eguale's work lies in its prescient diagnosis of a challenge that has only intensified. His ideas remain relevant for the wider post-colonial world. In an age dominated by a globalized, technocratic model of education, his defense of a humanistic ideal is a vital corrective. His analogy of knowledge as a “heavenly prophetess” versus a “fat cow” is more poignant than ever. An education that neglects the soul in its haste to train the hand is, in his view, a catastrophic failure.</p>
            <p>Eguale's model of “Tewahido” offers a powerful paradigm for navigating the challenge of how to modernize without sacrificing identity. It provides a philosophical basis for critical engagement rather than passive assimilation, arguing that indigenous traditions are the essential roots upon which any sustainable modernity must be built. Ultimately, Eguale's vision is not a retreat from the world but a radical re-engagement with it, grounded in self-knowledge and cultural confidence. He understood that progress required striving and excellence. In “ውድድርና ሽልማት” (“Competition and Reward"), he celebrates achievement. However, this modern drive must be framed within his overarching humanistic vision. The competition he envisions is not a ruthless struggle, but a noble striving for the common good. Eguale leaves us with a vision where the Faustian drive for achievement is harmonized with the Yaredic quest for wisdom, creating a future that is not only prosperous, but also just, humane, and whole.</p>
