        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Logic is often treated simultaneously as a field of study and as an instrument. As a field of study, it is a branch of philosophy that deals with the study of arguments and the principles and methods of right reasoning. As an instrument, it is something, which we can use to formulate our own rational arguments and critically evaluate the soundness of others' arguments. Before logic itself has become a field of study, philosophers have been using it as a basic tool to investigate issues that won their philosophical attention, such as, reality, knowledge, value, etc.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">
           Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, truth, beauty, law, justice, validity, mind, and language. It is a rational and critical enterprise that tries to answer fundamental questions through an intensive application of reason- an application that draws on analysis, comparison, and evaluation. It involves reason, rational criticism, examination, and analysis. In this chapter, we will learn the fundamental nature, concepts, features and areas of philosophy. Furthermore, we will discuss why it is so important to learn philosophy.

          Because of its universal nature, it is difficult to define philosophy in terms of a specific subject matter. However, we can define it etymologically as ‘love of wisdom’. Thus, as a pursuit of wisdom, philosophy refers to the development of critical habits, the continuous search for truth, and the questioning of the apparent. In this , students will be introduced with the fundamental meaning, nature, and concepts of philosophy.

                <p class="italic text-gray-600">Dear learners, do you have a prior awareness of philosophy? If so, how do you understand philosophy?</p>
            </div>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Dear learners, it is important to note first that giving a clear-cut definition of philosophy is difficult. It may be easy to define other disciplines, such as, chemistry, physics, geography, etc in terms of a subject matter, for they have their own specific subject matters to primarily deal with. However, it is difficult to do the same with philosophy, because philosophy has no a specific subject matter to primarily deal with. Philosophy deals primarily with issues. What contents philosophy has are not the specific subject matters, but issues, which are universal in nature. However, this should not lead us into thinking that philosophy is incomprehensible. It is only to say that whenever you want to understand philosophy, it is better to read different thoughts of philosophers, consciously see its salient features by yourself, participate in it, and do it.
            </p>
             <p class="text-gray-600">
               Philosophy is not as elusive as it is often thought to be. Nor is it remote from our various problems. It is unanimously agreed that the best way to learn and understand philosophy is to <strong>philosophize</strong>; i.e., to be confronted with philosophical questions, to use philosophical language, to become acquainted with differing philosophical positions and maneuvers, to read the philosophers themselves, and to grapple with the issues for oneself.
             </p>

        <div class="slide">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Meaning and Nature of Philosophy (Continued)</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Socrates once stated that <em>“Wonder is the feeling of a philosopher, and philosophy begins in wonder.”</em> It is true that most of us may not have a clear knowledge about the history, nature, language, and issues of philosophy. But, we all think and reflect in our own way about issues that matter us most. We all have touched and moved by the feelings of wonder from which all philosophy derives. Thus, we all participate, more or less, in philosophical issues, even though thinking alone cannot make us philosophers.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             If, however, you still want to find its clear-cut definition, it is better to refer to the etymology of the word itself, instead of trying to associate it with a certain specific subject matter. Etymologically, the word "philosophy" comes from two Greek words: "philos" and "sophia", which mean "love" and "wisdom", respectively. Thus, the literal definition of philosophy is "love of wisdom".
           </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
             The ancient Greek thinker Pythagoras was the first to use the word "philosopher" to call a person who clearly shows a marked curiosity in the things he experiences. Anyone who raises questions, such as Does God exists? What is reality? What is the ultimate source of Being? What is knowledge? What does it mean to know? How do we come to know? What is value?, and the like, is really showing a curiosity that can be described as a vital concern for becoming wise about the phenomena of the world and the human experiences. Therefore, seeking wisdom is among the various essences of philosophy that it has got from its etymological definition. Nevertheless, this is not sufficient by itself to understand philosophy, for not all wisdoms are philosophy.

        <!-- Slide 6: Wisdom and Questioning -->

           </div>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             The wisdom that philosophers seek is not the wisdom of the expertise or technical skills of professionals. Someone may be encyclopedic, and thus seemingly intelligent, but he may actually be foolish when it comes to understanding the meaning and significance of what he knows. According to Socrates, wisdom consists of a critical habit and eternal vigilance about all things and a reverence for truth, whatever its form, and wherever its place. Based on the Socratic understanding of wisdom, philosophy, as a pursuit of wisdom, is, thus, the development of critical habits, the continuous search for truth, and the questioning of the apparent.

               To interrogate the obvious means to deal creatively with the phenomenal world, to go beyond the common understanding, and to speculate about things that other people accept with no doubt.

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            But, questioning/criticism is not the final end of philosophy, though raising the right question is often taken not only as the beginning and direction of philosophy but also as its essence. Raising the right question is an art that includes the ability to foresee what is not readily obvious and to imagine different possibilities and alternatives of approaching the apparent. When we ultimately wonder about the existing world, and thus raise different questions about its order, each question moves us from the phenomenal facts to a profound speculation.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            The philosophical enterprise, as Vincent Barry stated, is <em>"an active imaginative process of formulating proper questions and resolving them by rigorous, persistent analysis"</em>.

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Therefore, philosophy is a rational and critical enterprise that tries to formulate and answer fundamental questions through an intensive application of reason- an application that draws on analysis, comparison, and evaluation. It involves reason, rational criticism, examination, and analysis. Accordingly, we can say that Philosophy has a <strong>constructive side</strong>, for it attempts to formulate rationally defensible answers to certain fundamental questions concerning the nature of reality, the nature of value, and the nature of knowledge and truth.
            </p>
             <p class="text-gray-600">
               At the same time, its <strong>critical side</strong> is manifested when it deals with giving a rational critic, analysis, clarification, and evaluation of answers given to basic metaphysical, epistemological, and axiological questions.

         <!-- Slide 9: Philosophy as Activity -->

           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             The other thing, which is worthy of noting, is that <strong>philosophy is an activity</strong>. It is not something that can be easily mastered or learned in schools. A philosopher is a great philosopher, not because he mastered philosophy, but because he did it. It is not his theory, but his extraordinary ability to critically think, to conceptualize, to analyze, to compare, to evaluate, and to understand- i.e., to <strong>philosophize</strong>- that makes him so.
           </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
              Of course, the product of philosophizing is philosophy as a product. However, what makes someone a great philosopher is not the produced philosophy, but his/her outstanding ability to philosophize.

             </div>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Dear learners, the general features of philosophy can be summarized as follows:</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-4">
              <li>
                <strong>Philosophy is a set of views or beliefs about life and the universe</strong>, which are often held uncritically.
                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-1">We refer to this meaning as the informal sense of philosophy or “having” a philosophy. Usually when a person says “my philosophy is,” he or she is referring to an informal personal attitude to whatever topic is being discussed.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Philosophy is a process of reflecting on and criticizing our most deeply held conceptions and beliefs.</strong>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-1">This is the formal sense of “doing” philosophy. These two senses of philosophy- “having” and “doing”- cannot be treated entirely independent of each other, if we did not have a philosophy in the formal, personal sense, then we could not *do* a philosophy in the critical, reflective sense. However, having a philosophy is not sufficient for doing philosophy. A genuine philosophical attitude is searching and critical; it is open-minded and tolerant- willing to look at all sides of an issue without prejudice.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              To philosophize is not merely to read and know philosophy; there are skills of argumentation to be mastered, techniques of analysis to be employed, and a body of material to be appropriated such that we become able to think philosophically.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              To philosophize also means to <strong>generalize</strong>. Philosophers are reflective and critical. They take a second look at the material presented by common sense. They attempt to think through a variety of life’s problems and to face all the facts impartially. The accumulation of knowledge does not by itself lead to understanding, because it does not necessarily teach the mind to make a critical evaluation of facts that entail consistent and coherent judgment.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
              Critical evaluations often differ. Philosophers, theologians, scientists, and others disagree, first because they view things from different points of view and with different assumptions. Their personal experiences, cultural backgrounds, and training may vary widely. This is especially true of people living at different times and in different places. A second reason philosophers disagree is that they live in a changing universe. People change, society changes, and nature changes. Some people are responsive and sensitive to change; others cling to tradition and the status quo, to systems that were formulated some time ago and that were declared to be authoritative and final. A third reason philosophers disagree is that they deal with an area of human experience in which the evidence is not complete. Different people may interpret the evidence we do have in various ways. Despite these disagreements, however, philosophers continue to probe, examine, and evaluate the material with the hope of presenting consistent principles by which we can live.

               <span class="font-semibold">3) Philosophy is a rational attempt to look at the world as a whole.</span>
                Philosophy seeks to combine the conclusions of the various sciences and human experience into some kind of consistent worldview. Philosophers wish to see life, not with the specialized slant of the scientist or the businessperson or the artist, but with the overall view of someone cognizant of life as a totality. Although there are difficulties and dangers in setting forth any worldview, there also are dangers in confining attention to fragments of human experience. Philosophy attempts to give a view of the whole, a life and a worldview, and to integrate the knowledge of the sciences with that of other disciplines to achieve a consistent whole. Philosophy, according to this view, attempts to bring the results of human inquiry- religious, historical, and scientific into some meaningful interpretation that provides knowledge and insight for our lives.
             </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600">
                <span class="font-semibold">4) Philosophy is the logical analysis of language and the clarification of the meaning of words and concepts.</span>
                 Certainly, this is one function of philosophy. In fact, nearly all philosophers have used methods of analysis and have sought to clarify the meaning of terms and the use of language. Some philosophers see this as the main task of philosophy, and a few claim this is the only legitimate function of philosophy. Such persons consider philosophy a specialized field serving the sciences and aiding in the clarification of language rather than a broad field reflecting on all of life’s experiences. This outlook has gained considerable support during the twentieth century. It would limit what we call knowledge to statements about observable facts and their interrelations i.e., to the business of the various sciences. Not all linguistic analysts, however, define knowledge so narrowly. Although they do reject and try to “clean up” many non-scientific assertions, many of them think that we can have knowledge of ethical principles and the like, although this knowledge is also experientially derived. Those who take the narrower view neglect, when they do not deny, all generalized worldviews and life views, as well as traditional moral philosophy and theology. From this narrower point of view, the aim of philosophy is to expose confusion and nonsense and to clarify the meaning and use of terms in science and everyday affairs.

              <span class="font-semibold">5) Philosophy is a group of perennial problems that interest people and for which philosophers always have sought answers.</span>
               Philosophy presses its inquiry into the deepest problems of human existence. Some of the philosophical questions raised in the past have been answered in a manner satisfactory to the majority of philosophers. Many questions, however, have been answered only tentatively, and many problems remain unsolved. What are philosophical questions? The question “Did Ram make a false statement on his income tax return?” is merely a question of fact. However, the questions “What is truth?” and “What is the distinction between right and wrong?” have philosophical importance. Sometimes we think seriously about fundamental life issues: What is life and why am I here? Why is there anything at all? What is the place of life in this great universe? Is the universe friendly or unfriendly? Do things operate by chance or through sheer mechanism, or is there some plan, purpose, or intelligence at the heart of things? Is my life controlled by outside forces, or do I have a determining or even a partial degree of control? Why do people struggle and strive for their rights, for justice, for better things in the future? What do concepts like “right” and “justice” means, and what are the marks of a good society? Often men and women have been asked to sacrifice their lives, if need be, for certain values and ideals. What are the genuine values of life and how can it attained? Is there really a fundamental distinction between right and wrong, or is it just a matter of one’s own opinions? What is beauty? Should religion count in a person’s life? Is it intellectually valid to believe in God? Is there a possibility of a “life after death?” Is there any way we can get an answer to these and many related questions? Where does knowledge come from, and can we have any assurances that anything is true?

               The above questions are all philosophical. The attempt to seek answers or solutions to them has given rise to theories and systems of thought, such as idealism, realism, pragmatism, analytic philosophy, existentialism, phenomenology, and process philosophy. Philosophy also means the various theories or systems of thought developed by the great philosophers, such as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Royce, James, Dewey, Whitehead, and others. Without these people and their thoughts, philosophy would not have the rich content it has today. Even though we may be unconscious of the fact, we are constantly influenced by ideas that have come down to us in the traditions of society.

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Dear learners, we have said earlier that philosophy is a rational and critical enterprise that tries to formulate and answer fundamental questions through an intensive application of reason- an application that draws on analysis, comparison, and evaluation. It deals with the most basic issues faced by human beings. The content of philosophy is better seen as asking the right questions rather than providing the correct answers. It even can be said that philosophy is the study of questions, the "right" questions. By "right" he meant questions that are meaningful and relevant- the kind of questions people really want answered and that will make a difference in how they live and work.

             Philosophy has different primary and secondary branches. This course deals only with the primary ones, namely Metaphysics, Epistemology, Axiology, and Logic. Metaphysics is the most important fields of philosophy that deal with the studies of ultimate reality and human knowledge, respectively. In this , we will discuss the first two major fields, Metaphysics and Epistemology, and we will deal with the remaining two fields, Axiology and Logic, in the next (4).

             <strong>Metaphysics</strong> is the branch of philosophy that studies the ultimate nature of reality or existence. It deal with issues of reality, God, freedom, soul/immortality, the mind-body problem, form and substance relationship, cause and effect relationship, and other related issues. Metaphysicians seek an irreducible foundation of reality or ‘first principles’ from which absolute knowledge or truth can be induced and deduced. The term metaphysics is derived from the Greek words <em>“meta”</em> meaning “beyond”, “upon” or “after”) and <em>physika</em>, means (“physics”). Literally, it refers ‘those things after the physics.’ Aristotle’s writings on ‘first philosophy’ came after his treatise on physics, therefore, Aristotle’s editor, Andronicus of Rhodes, named them metaphysics.

           <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Metaphysics - Reality Example</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              At first, questions like, ‘What is real?’ seem too simple to bother asking. But consider George Knight’s example about the existence of a floor and one will see that the question has far reaching implications: What is exactly the nature of the floor upon which you stand? It may seem to have a rather straightforward existence. It is obviously flat, solid, and smooth; it has a particular color; it is composed of an identifiable material, such as wood or concrete; and it supports your weight.
            </p>
             <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
               Suppose, however, that a physicist enters the room and questioned about the reality of the floor. She will reply that the floor is made of molecules; that molecules consist of atoms, electrons, protons, and neutrons; and these, finally, of electric energy alone. A third position is offered by a passing chemist. To him the floor is a hotbed of hydrocarbons associated in a particular way and subject to certain kinds of environmental influences, such as heat, cold, wetness, dryness, and oxidation.
             </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                It is evident that the question of reality is not as simplistic as it appears. If the reality of a common floor is confusing, what about the larger problems that presents themselves as humankind searches for the ultimate reality of the universe?

              <p class="text-gray-600">
                Metaphysical questions are the most basic to ask because they provide the foundation upon which all subsequent inquiry is based. Metaphysical questions may be divided into four subsets or aspects.

           <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-4">
             <li>
               <strong>Cosmological Aspect:</strong> Cosmology consists in the study of theories about the origin, nature, and development of the universe as an orderly system. Questions such as these populate the realm of cosmology: “How did the universe originate and develop? Did it come about by accident or design? Does its existence have any purpose?”
             </li>
             <li>
               <strong>Theological Aspect:</strong> Theology is that part of religious theory that deals with conceptions of and about God. “Is there a God? If so, is there one or more than one? What are the attributes of God? If God is both all good and all powerful, why does evil exist? If God exists, what is His relationship to human beings and the ‘real’ world of everyday life?”
             </li>
             <li>
               <strong>Anthropological Aspect:</strong> Anthropology deals with the study of human beings and asks questions like the following: What is the relation between mind and body? Is mind more fundamental than body, with body depending on mind, or vice versa? What is humanity’s moral status? Are people born good, evil, or morally neutral? To what extent are individuals free? Do they have free will, or are their thoughts and actions determined by their environment, inheritance, or a divine being? Does each person have a soul? If so, what is it? People have obviously adopted different positions on these questions, and those positions influence their political, social, religious, and educational ideals and practices.

             <li>
               <strong>Ontological Aspect:</strong> Ontology is the study of the nature of existence, or what it means for anything to exist. Several questions are central to ontology: “Is basic reality found in matter or physical energy (the world we can sense), or is it found in spirit or spiritual energy? Is it composed of one element (e.g., matter or spirit), or two (e.g., matter and spirit), or many?” “Is reality orderly and lawful in itself, or is it merely orderable by the human mind? Is it fixed and stable, or is change its central feature? Is this reality friendly, unfriendly, or neutral toward humanity?”

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              <strong>Epistemology</strong> is the other field of philosophy that studies about the nature, scope, meaning, and possibility of knowledge. It deals with issues of knowledge, opinion, truth, falsity, reason, experience, and faith.
            </p>
             <p class="text-gray-600">
               Etymologically, the word epistemology has been derived from the Greek words <em>episteme</em>, meaning “knowledge, understanding”, and <em>logos</em>, meaning “study of”. In other words, we can say that Epistemology is the study of the nature, source, and validity of knowledge. It seeks to answer of the basic questions as “What is true?” and “How do we know?” Thus, epistemology covers two areas: the <strong>content of thought</strong> and <strong>thought itself</strong>. The study of epistemology deals with issues related to the dependability of knowledge and the validity of the sources through which we gain information.

           <div class="slide">
              <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Epistemology - Skepticism & Agnosticism</h2>
               <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                 Epistemology seeks answers to a number of fundamental issues. One is whether reality can even be known. <strong>Skepticism</strong> in its narrow sense is the position claiming that people cannot acquire reliable knowledge and that any search for truth is in vain. That thought was well expressed by Gorgias, the Greek Sophist who asserted that nothing exists, and that if it did, we could not know it. A full-blown skepticism would make intelligent action impossible.
               </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                  A term closely related to skepticism is <strong>agnosticism</strong>. Agnosticism is a profession of ignorance in reference to the existence or nonexistence of God.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                  Most people claim that reality can be known. However, once they have taken that position, they must decide through what sources reality may be known, and must have some concept of how to judge the validity of their knowledge. A second issue foundational to epistemology is whether all truth is relative, or whether some truths are absolute. Is all truth subject to change? Is it possible that what is true today may be false tomorrow? If the answer is “Yes” to the previous questions, such truths are relative. If, however, there is Absolute Truth, such Truth is eternally and universally true irrespective of time or place. Closely related to the issue of the relativity and absoluteness of truth are the questions of whether knowledge is subjective or objective, and whether there is truth that is independent of human experience.

           <!-- Slide 25: Epistemology - Sources of Human Knowledge: Empiricism -->
           <div class="slide">
              <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Epistemology - Sources of Knowledge: Empiricism</h2>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                A major aspect of epistemology relates to the sources of human knowledge. If one accepts the fact that there is truth and even Truth in the universe, how can human beings comprehend such truths? How do they become human knowledge? Central to most people’s answer to that question is <strong>empiricism</strong> (knowledge obtained through the senses). Empirical knowledge appears to be built into the very nature of human experience. Thus, when individuals walk out of doors on a spring day and see the beauty of the landscape, hear the song of a bird, feel the warm rays of the sun, and smell the fragrance of the blossoms, they “know” that it is spring. Sensory knowing for humans is immediate and universal, and in many ways forms the basis of much of human knowledge.
              </p>
               <p class="text-gray-600">
                 The existence of sensory data cannot be denied. Most people accept it uncritically as representing “reality.” The danger of naively embracing this approach is that data obtained from the human senses have been demonstrated to be both incomplete and undependable. (For example, most people have been confronted with the contradiction of seeing a stick that looks bent when partially submerged in water but appears to be straight when examined in the air.) Fatigue, frustration, and illness also distort and limit sensory perception. In addition, there are sound and light waves that are inaudible and invisible to unaided human perception.
               </p>
           </div>

           <!-- Slide 26: Epistemology - Sources: Empiricism Cont. & Rationalism -->
           <div class="slide">
             <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Sources: Empiricism Cont. & Rationalism</h2>
             <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Humans have invented scientific instruments to extend the range of their senses, but it is impossible to ascertain the exact dependability of these instruments since no one knows the total effect of the human mind in recording, interpreting, and distorting sensual perception. Confidence in these instruments is built upon speculative metaphysical theories whose validity has been reinforced by experimentation in which predictions have been verified through the use of a theoretical construct or hypothesis. In general, sensory knowledge is built upon assumptions that must be accepted by faith in the dependability of human sensory mechanisms. The advantage of empirical knowledge is that many sensory experiences and experiments are open to both replication and public examination.
             </p>
             <p class="text-gray-600">
               A second important source of human knowledge is reason. The view that reasoning, thought, or logic is the central factor in knowledge is known as <strong>rationalism</strong>. The rationalist, in emphasizing humanity’s power of thought and the mind’s contributions to knowledge, is likely to claim that the senses alone cannot provide universal, valid judgments that are consistent with one another. From this perspective, the sensations and experiences humans obtain through their senses are the raw material of knowledge. These sensations must be organized by the mind into a meaningful system before they become knowledge. Rationalism in a less extreme form claims that people have the power to know with certainty various truths about the universe that the senses alone cannot give. In its extreme form, rationalism claims that humans are capable of arriving at irrefutable knowledge independently of sensory experience. Formal logic is a tool used by rationalists. Systems of logic have the advantage of possessing internal consistency, but they risk being disconnected from the external world. Systems of thought based upon logic are only as valid as the premises upon which they are built.

             <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Epistemology - Sources: Intuition & Revelation</h2>
             <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
               A third source of human knowledge is <strong>intuition</strong>- the direct apprehension of knowledge that is not derived from conscious reasoning or immediate sense perception. In the literature dealing with intuition, one often finds such expressions as “immediate feeling of certainty.” Intuition occurs beneath the threshold of consciousness and is often experienced as a sudden flash of insight. Intuition has been claimed under varying circumstances as a source of both religious and secular knowledge. Certainly many scientific breakthroughs have been initiated by intuitive hunches that were confirmed by experimentation. The weakness or danger of intuition is that it does not appear to be a safe method of obtaining knowledge when used alone. It goes astray very easily and may lead to absurd claims unless it is controlled by or checked against other methods of knowing. Intuitive knowledge, however, has the distinct advantage of being able to bypass the limitations of human experience.
             </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600">
                A fourth influential source of knowledge throughout the span of human history has been <strong>revelation</strong>. Revealed knowledge has been of prime importance in the field of religion. It differs from all other sources of knowledge because it presupposes a transcendent supernatural reality concerning the divine will. Believers in supernatural revelation hold that this form of knowledge has the distinct advantage of being an omniscient source of information that is not available through other epistemological methods. The truth revealed through this source is believed by Christians to be absolute and uncontaminated. On the other hand, it is generally realized that distortion of revealed truth can occur in the process of human interpretation. Some people assert that a major disadvantage of revealed knowledge is that it must be accepted by faith and cannot be proved or disproved empirically.

             <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
               A fifth source of human knowledge, though not a philosophical position, is <strong>authority</strong>. Authoritative knowledge is accepted as true because it comes from experts or has been sanctified over time as tradition. In the classroom, the most common source of information is some authority, such as a textbook, teacher, or reference work. Accepting authority as a source of knowledge has its advantages as well as its dangers. Civilization would certainly stagnate if people refused to accept any statement unless they personally verified it through direct, firsthand experience. On the other hand, if authoritative knowledge is built upon a foundation of incorrect assumptions, then such knowledge will surely be distorted.
             </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600">
                Dear learners, it is important to note that one source of information alone might not be capable of supplying people with all knowledge. It might be important to see the various sources as complementary rather than antagonistic. However, it is true that most people choose one source as being more basic than, or preferable to, the others, and then use it as a benchmark for testing other sources of knowledge. For example, in the contemporary world, knowledge obtained empirically is generally seen as the most basic and reliable type.

               <strong>Axiology</strong> is the study or theory of value. The term Axiology stems from two Greek words- <em>“Axios”</em>, meaning “value, worth”, and <em>“logos”</em>, meaning “reason/ theory/ symbol/ science/study of”. Hence, Axiology is the philosophical study of value, which originally meant the worth of something. Axiology asks the philosophical questions of values that deal with notions of what a person or a society regards as good or preferable, such as:

Ethics has three main branches: meta-ethics, normative ethics, and applied ethics.

             <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
               <strong>Normative Ethics</strong> refers to the ethical studies that attempt to study and determine precisely the moral rules, principles, standards and goals by which human beings might evaluate and judge the moral values of their conducts, actions and decisions. It is the reasoned search for principles of human conduct, including a critical study of the major theories about which things are good, which acts are right, and which acts are blameworthy. Consequentialism or Teleological Ethics, Deontological Ethics, and Virtue Ethics are the major examples of normative ethical studies.
             </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                <strong>Meta-ethics</strong> is the highly technical philosophical discipline that deals with investigation of the meaning of ethical terms, including a critical study of how ethical statements can be verified. It is more concerned with the meanings of such ethical terms as good or bad and right or wrong than with what we think is good or bad and right or wrong. Moral Intuitionism, Moral Emotivism, Moral Prescriptivism, Moral Nihilism, and Ethical Relativism are the main examples of meta-ethical studies.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600">
                <strong>Applied Ethics</strong> is a normative ethics that attempts to explain, justify, apply moral rules, principles, standards, and positions to specific moral problems, such as capital punishment, euthanasia, abortion, adultery, animal right, and so on. This area of normative ethics is termed applied because the ethicist applies or uses general ethical princes in an attempt to resolve specific moral problems.

The ancient Greek philosopher, Socrates, once said that <em>“I tell you that to let no day pass without discussing goodness and all the other subjects about which you hear me talking and examining both myself and others is really the best thing that a man can do, and that life without this sort of examination is not worth living…”</em>. Thus, among the various benefits of learning philosophy is that philosophy provides students with the tools they need to critically examine their own lives as well as the world in which they live. Let us clarify it more.

               <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                 Some modern psychologists point out that human beings have both maintenance and actualizing needs. The former refer to the physical and psychological needs that we must satisfy in order to maintain ourselves as human beings: food, shelter, security, social interaction, and the like. The later appear to be associated with self-fulfillment, creativity, self-expression, realization of one’s potential, and being everything one can be.
               </p>
               <p class="text-gray-600">
                 Although philosophy may not necessarily lead to this sort of self-actualization, it can assist us to actualize ourselves by promoting the ideal of self-actualization. There are many characteristics of self-actualization to whose achievement studying philosophy has a primordial contribution. Here below are some of them.
               </p>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Intellectual and Behavioral Independence:</strong>- This is the ability to develop one’s own opinion and beliefs. Among the primary goals of philosophy, one is the integration of experiences into a unified, coherent, and systematic world views. Studying philosophy helps us not only to know the alternative world views but also to know how philosophers have ordered the universe for themselves. As a result, we can learn how to develop and integrate our experiences, thoughts, feelings, and actions for ourselves, and thus how to be intellectually and behaviorally independent.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Reflective Self-Awareness:</strong>- self-actualization cannot be realized without a clear knowledge of oneself and the world in which one lives. Philosophy helps us to intensify our self awareness by inviting us to critically examine the essential intellectual grounds of our lives.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Flexibility, Tolerance, and Open-Mindedness:</strong>- by studying different philosophical perspectives we can understand the evolutionary nature of intellectual achievement and the ongoing development of human thought. As we confront with the thoughts of various philosophers we can easily realize that no viewpoint is necessarily true or false- that the value of any attitude is contextual. Finally, we become more tolerant, open-minded, more receptive, and more sympathetic to views that contend or clash with ours.

                 <li>
                   <strong>Creative and Critical Thinking:</strong>- this is the ability to develop original philosophical perspective on issues, problems, and events; and to engage them on a deeper level. From the study of philosophy, we can learn how to refine our powers of analysis, our abilities to think critically, to reason, to evaluate, to theorize, and to justify.

                 <li>
                   <strong>Conceptualized and well-thought-out value systems in morality, art, politics, and the like:</strong>- since philosophy directly deals with morality, art, politics, and other related value theories, studying philosophy provides us with an opportunity to formulate feasible evaluations of value; and thereby to find meaning in our lives.

                 <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                   The other benefit of studying philosophy that should not be missed is that it helps us to deal with the uncertainty of living. Philosophy helps us to realize the absence of an absolutely ascertained knowledge, and hence prepare ourselves to the ever growing human knowledge.

                  <p class="text-gray-600">
                    But, what is the advantage of uncertainty? What Bertrand Russell stated in his book, <em>The Problem of Philosophy</em>, can be a sufficient answer for this question.

               <blockquote>
                 <p>
                   The value of philosophy is, in part, to be sought largely in its very uncertainty. The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual benefits of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the cooperation or consent of his deliberate reason. To such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected. As soon as we begin to philosophize, on the contrary, even the commonest things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given. Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never traveled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect (Bertrand, 1912, P; 158).

               <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Chapter Summary</h2>
               <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                 Logic, as a field of study, is a branch of philosophy that deals with the study of arguments and the principles and methods of right reasoning. Etymologically, the term “philosophy” can be defined as “love of wisdom”, being wisdom a critical habit and eternal vigilance about all things and a reverence for truth, whatever its form, and wherever its place. Therefore, philosophy, as a pursuit of wisdom, is the development of critical habits, the continuous search for truth, and the questioning of the apparent. It is, however, important to note that “questioning the apparent” does not mean denying the obviously real. It simply refers to the extraordinary ability and curiosity to deal creatively with the phenomenal world, to go beyond the common understanding, and to speculate about things that other people accept with no doubt.

                  Philosophy, as a rational and critical enterprise that tries to formulate and answer fundamental questions through an intensive application of reason, is a dual-sided universal discipline: critical and constructive sides. While, as a critical discipline, it deals with giving a rational critic, analysis, clarification, and evaluation of answers given to basic metaphysical, epistemological, and axiological questions, it attempts, as a constructive discipline, to formulate rationally defensible answers to certain fundamental questions concerning the nature of reality, the nature of value, and the nature of knowledge and truth.

                  Philosophy, as an academic discipline, has its own salient features that distinguish it from other academic disciplines. Its systematic, logical and flexible approach to the ultimate reality of the universe, human life, knowledge experience, truth and values and its holistic and evolutionary nature are some the fundamental features of philosophy.

                   Philosophy uses its major branches to deal with the most important issues human beings face, namely Metaphysics, Epistemology, Axiology, and Logic. Metaphysics deals with the studies of ultimate reality and existence. Epistemology deals with the study of the meaning, nature, source, scope and possibility of human knowledge. Axiology deals with the philosophical studies of human values, such as moral values, aesthetic values, as well as political and social values. Logic, on the other hand, is a philosophical study of arguments and the methods and principles of right reasoning.

                   Philosophy provides various fundamental benefits to learners. It provides students with the tools they need to critically examine their own lives as well as the world in which they live, it assist them to actualize themselves by promoting the ideals of self-actualization. That is, studying philosophy helps to achieve the most important characteristic of self-actualization: Intellectual and Behavioral Independence, Reflective Self-Awareness, Flexibility, Tolerance, and Open-Mindedness, Creative and Critical Thinking, and Conceptualized and well-thought-out value systems in morality, art, politics, and the like. Moreover, studying philosophy helps us to deal with the uncertainty of living, meaning it helps us to realize the absence of an absolutely ascertained knowledge, and hence prepare ourselves to the ever growing human knowledge.
