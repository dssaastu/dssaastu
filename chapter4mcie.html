                      <h1>Chapter Introduction</h1>
    <p>This chapter discusses the issue of the notion of state, basic features of state, the role of state and the state structure, government types and systems, and citizenship. It starts by defining the terms and then proceeds to the dimensions and theories of state, government, and citizenship.</p>
    <p>Though there are many theories on these areas, in this chapter we will focus on the major schools of thought and perspectives.</p>

                        <h1>Defining "State"</h1>
    <p>The term "state" has not been defined precisely. The term 'state' has been applied to a wide variety of things, including a collection of institutions, a territorial entity, a philosophical idea, a coercive or oppressive weapon, and so on.</p>
    <p>This perplexity is due in part to the fact that the state has been interpreted in five different ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Idealist perspective</li>
        <li>Functionalist perspective</li>
        <li>Pluralist view of the state</li>
        <li>Organizational perspective</li>
        <li>International perspective</li>
    </ul>

                      <h1>The Idealist Approach to the State</h1>
    <p>This view is mostly demonstrated in Hegel's writings. Hegel identified three moments of social existence: the family, civil society, and the state.</p>
    <p>He claimed that within the family, a special kind of altruism exists, encouraging people to put their own interests aside for the sake of their children or older relatives.</p>
    <p>In contrast, civil society was seen as a sphere of ‘universal egoism’ in which individuals place their own interests before those of others. Freedom was not the capacity to do as one liked but was the alignment with a universal will toward well-being.</p>
    <p>When men acted as moral agents, the conflict ceased, and their aims coincided. Subordinating himself to the state, the individual was able to realize a synthesis between the values of family and the needs of economic life.</p>
    <p>To Hegel, the state was the culmination of moral action, where freedom of choice had led to the unity of the rational will, and all parts of society were nourished within the health of the whole. Hegel conceived of the state as an ethical community underpinned by mutual sympathy – ‘universal altruism’.</p>
    <p>The drawback of idealism (Hegel’s approach to the state), however, is that it fosters an uncritical reverence for the state and, by defining the state in ethical terms, fails to distinguish clearly between institutions that are part of the state and those that are outside the state.</p>

                        <h1>Functionalist Approaches to the State</h1>
    <p>Functionalist approaches to the state focus on the role or purpose of state institutions. The central function of the state is invariably seen as the maintenance of social order, the state being defined as that set of institutions that uphold order and deliver social stability.</p>
    <p>Such an approach has been adopted by neo-Marxists who have been inclined to see the state as a mechanism through which class conflict is ameliorated to ensure the long-term survival of the capitalist system.</p>
    <p>The weakness of the functionalist view of the state, however, is that it tends to associate any institution that maintains order (such as the family, mass media, trade unions, and the church) with the state itself.</p>

                       <h1>Pluralist View of the State</h1>
<p>It views society as a collection of individuals and groups who are competing for political power. The state is a neutral body that simply enacts the will of whichever groups dominate the electoral process.</p>
<p>Robert Dahl developed the theory of the state as a neutral arena for contending interests or its agencies as simply another set of interest groups. With power competitively arranged in society, state policy is a product of recurrent bargaining.</p>
<p>Although pluralism recognizes the existence of inequality, it asserts that all groups have an opportunity to pressure the state. The pluralist approach suggests that the modern democratic state's actions are the result of pressures applied by a variety of organized interests. Dahl called this kind of state a polyarchy.</p>
<h2>Critics of the Pluralist View of the State</h2>
<p>Pluralism has been challenged on the ground that it is not supported by empirical evidence. Citing surveys showing that the large majority of people in high leadership positions are members of the wealthy upper class, critics argue that the state serves the interests of the upper class rather than equitably serving the interests of all social groups.</p>

                        <h1>The Organizational View of the State</h1>
<p>The organizational view defines the state as the apparatus of government in its broadest sense. The state is a set of institutions that are recognizably ‘public’, responsible for the collective organization of social existence.</p>
<p>The strength of this definition is that it distinguishes clearly between the state and civil society. The state comprises the various institutions of government: the bureaucracy, the military, the police, the courts, and the social security system.</p>
<p>The state is identified with the entire ‘body politic’.</p>

                       <h1>The International Approach to the State</h1>
<p>The international approach views the state primarily as an actor on the world stage. The state is the basic ‘unit’ of international politics.</p>
<p>This approach highlights the dualistic structure of the state; the fact that it has two faces: one looking outwards and the other looking inwards.</p>
<p>Whereas previous definitions are concerned with the state’s inward-looking face, its relations with the individuals and groups that live within its borders, and its ability to maintain domestic order, the international view deals with the state’s outward-looking face, its relations with other states, and its ability to provide protection against external attack.</p>

                        <h1>Montevideo Convention Approach</h1>
<p>The classic definition of the state in international law is found in the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of the State (1933).</p>
<p>According to Article 1 of the Montevideo Convention, the state has four features: a defined territory, permanent population, an effective government, and sovereignty.</p>
<p>From the above definitions, it can be inferred that the state is a collection of institutions, a territorial unit, has ultimate authority, and has its own defined population. However, there is no consensus and universally agreed-upon definition of the state.</p>

                        <h1>Attributes (Elements) of State</h1>
<p>The state has four essential elements. These are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Population</li>
    <li>Territory</li>
    <li>Government</li>
    <li>Sovereignty (or independence)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Population</h2>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule about population. The ancient Greek writers like Plato and Aristotle favored a small population. According to Plato, an ideal state should have a population of 5040. Aristotle laid down a general principle that the population of a state should be large enough to make it sufficient and small enough to make good government possible. It must be noted that both of them were thinking in terms of small city-states.</p>
<p>In modern times, Rousseau, prompted by considerations of direct democracy, fixed the number at 10,000. States vary greatly from the few thousands of Monaco or of San Marino to the billion of China or of India. The modern tendency is in favour of large states. A large population is an advantage from the point of view of defense. However, a large population can be a liability if the resources of the state are not adequate for its maintenance. One of the main problems faced by developing countries is overpopulation. Thus, there should be a happy balance between the size of the population and the material wealth of a state.</p>

<h2>Territory</h2>
<p>A definite and more or less permanent territory is also regarded as an essential element of the state. In modern times, the citizens are bound together by residence on a common territory. Land, water, and air space comprise the territory of a state.</p>
<p>As in population, so in territory, no limit can be laid down. Small states and large ones exist side by side. We have tiny states like San Marino with an area of less than twenty-five square miles. On the other hand, there are giant states like the Russian Republic, China, U.S.A., and Australia with millions of square miles.</p>
<p>According to international law, all states are equal in status and right, no matter how unequal they are in population and area. It is claimed that small states are good for efficient administration and inculcating among the people a sense of unity and love for the state. However, the truth is that a small state is at a disadvantage in its relations with larger ones. Small states are under the influence of one or the other large and powerful state. Large states are strong in defense.</p>

<h2>Government</h2>
<p>A people occupying a definite territory cannot form a state unless they are politically organized, i.e., unless they possess a government. Government is the political organization of the state. It is the concrete and visible instrument of state power. According to Garner, government is the agency through which "common policies are determined and by which common affairs are regulated." The state wills and acts through the government.</p>
<p>Government must be effective; it must possess the capacity to maintain order and enforce obedience. Without a government, there would be lawlessness and anarchy, and ultimately the state would be dissolved.</p>
<p>Government consists of three organs, namely, legislature, executive, and judiciary. The legislature makes laws; the executive enforces laws while the judiciary adjudicates cases or disputes. There are different kinds (types) of government in different states such as monarchy, democracy, and dictatorship.</p>
<p>Whatever may be the form of government, one thing is clear - there can be no state without government.</p>
<p>The modern world has revolutionized to adopt democratic and republic government as the best and functional system of governance. Over the years, there have been many wars and protests, waged at small and large scales to overthrow dynasties and monarchs and end the rule of single leaders. But even today, there are several countries where the monarchial system of government persists without disturbance. Most of these countries are amongst the world’s richest and have flourished both economically and culturally under the rule of their monarchs. Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Andorra, Switzerland, and Oman are examples of the monarchical system of government.</p>
<p>The issue of legitimacy is a reason for governments to differ from one state to another. Legitimacy is the popular acceptance of a governing regime or system of governance. Different governments follow different mechanisms to achieve legitimacy to rule over the people. Certain democratic governments have been trying to achieve it through democratic elections while others have been trying to achieve it through economic transformation.</p>
<p>Governments also differ on the issue of authority (a real capacity of a government to exercise its legitimate or formal political power to rule the people effectively). Some states have such required authority; others lack it due to political inefficiency resulting from a lack of either allegiance or obedience. Another area of difference between states is the form/system of their governments (how the government is organized and how it makes divisions of power among its different branches and institutions).</p>
<p>Some states organize through constitutional mechanisms; other states do it through force or some traditions. Some states adopt a presidential system of government in which ultimate authority lies under a strong president directly elected to serve both as the head of state and head of government. Other states adopt a parliamentary system in which the parliament is the most powerful organ with the ultimate decision-making power.</p>

<h2>Sovereignty</h2>
<p>The most important characteristic of the state is its sovereignty. It is the characteristic that distinguishes the state from all other associations. It denotes the supreme power or the final authority from which there is no appeal.</p>
<p>Sovereignty has two aspects: internal and external. Internally viewed, the state has supreme power over all individuals and associations within its fixed area. It can compel the obedience of its people to its laws and commands. Externally viewed, the state is free from the control of any foreign state or alien rule. It should be noted, however, that absolute sovereignty is a legal concept. Absolute sovereignty is not feasible. In actual practice, no state is able to exercise unlimited power either over individuals and associations within its territorial domain or in its international relations.</p>
<p>A state needs to abide by international laws. Otherwise, there will be international anarchy causing serious threats to international peace and security. Laski has rightly argued that unlimited sovereignty is a threat to world peace and humanity.</p>

<h2>Recognition</h2>
<p>In modern times, relations among nations have grown, and many international organizations and institutions have come into being. Therefore, some scholars have argued that international recognition is an essential element of the state. The recognition of the sovereign status of a new state by other states is called international recognition.</p>
<p>There is no agreement on how many countries would have to recognize a new state so that the latter gains statehood in the eyes of international law. Recognition also has a political dimension. China was already a full-fledged state for many years before the UN was established in 1945. China came under communist rule in 1949. Communist China took its legitimate place in the UN in the 1970s only after the establishment of rapprochement between the US and communist China.</p>
<p>It needs to be emphasized that even when communist China was not a member of the UN, it was very much a state.</p>

<p>The first two elements constitute the physical or material basis of the state while the last two form its political and legal basis. The fifth one is not as essential as the first four, but highly indispensable for the state which is recognition.</p>

                       <h1>Divine Origin Approach</h1>
<p>The oldest model about the origin of the state is the divine origin model. It is also known as the theory of the divine right of Kings. The exponents of this theory believe that the state did not come into being by any effort of man; it is created by God. The King who rules over the state is an agent of God on earth. The King derives his authority from God, and for all his actions, he is responsible to God alone. Obedience to the King is ordained by God, and violation of it will be a sin. The King is above the law, and no subject has any right to question his authority or his actions. The King is responsible to God alone.</p>

<p>The conception of the divine creation of the state may be traced back to remote antiquity. It was a universal belief among ancient peoples that the King is the representative of God on earth and that the state is a blessing of God. Thus, the King had both political and religious significance. In religious texts, the state is often described as being created by God. In some religions, this conception is explicit, while in others it is implicit. Both the church and the state utilized the theory of divine origin during the medieval age. The church asserted its supremacy over the state, while the state, due to its divine nature, emphasized its supremacy over the church. Even if the King is unjust, the people have no right to rebel against him.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century, the Kings of Austria, Prussia, and Russia formed the Holy Alliance under the notion that they were appointed by God to rule over their people. European Kings often relied on the divine origin theory to justify their dictatorships. For a long time, the state was viewed as a direct divine creation and theocratic in nature. This theory remained prevalent as long as religion was seen as the chief motivating force behind human activities.</p>

<h2>Causes for the Decline of the Divine Model</h2>
<p>Several factors contributed to the decline of the divine model:</p>
<ol>
    <li>When a more acceptable theory, such as the social contract approach, emerged, the divine theory was undermined. The new model suggested that the state is a creation of humans, not a gift from God.</li>
    <li>The Reformation, which separated the church from the state, diminished the credibility of the divine theory. The post-Reformation period saw a shift towards non-religious politics, making the divine theory unacceptable.</li>
    <li>The rise of democracy dealt a significant blow to the autocratic doctrine that intertwined religion with politics, undermining the divine association of God with the King. Democracy celebrated the individual and shattered the divine image surrounding the state's origin.</li>
    <li>The growth of scientific inquiry and a materialistic view of political mechanisms made blind faith and superstition less acceptable. People began to value ideas that could withstand logical and rational scrutiny.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Criticism of the Divine Approach</h2>
<p>There are seven lines of argument against the divine model:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The state is a human institution organized through human agency. Modern political thinkers reject the notion that God has any role in the state's creation.</li>
    <li>The divine theory can lead to dangerous outcomes, as a semi-divine King may rule arbitrarily, ignoring public opinion. This can result in despotism and autocracy.</li>
    <li>The divine theory justifies the rule of bad leaders under a divine shield, undermining the idea of accountability. Historical examples exist where rulers like James II of England and Louis XVI of France were replaced by the people, which contradicts the divine theory.</li>
    <li>The divine theory contradicts the fundamental teachings of religious codes. The New Testament, for instance, emphasizes a human perspective of the state, stating, “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and unto God the things that are God’s.”</li>
    <li>The divine theory is deemed unscientific. Anthropologists and sociologists have discarded it as a plausible explanation for the state's origin.</li>
    <li>The theory runs counter to the widely accepted view that the state results from historical evolution, influenced by factors like religion, family, force, and political consciousness.</li>
    <li>The divine theory is fundamentally undemocratic, implying that the King is absolute and his government cannot be democratic.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Value of the Divine Approach</h2>
<p>Despite being discredited as the origin of the state, the divine model has some merits. It instilled discipline and law-abidingness among subjects during a time when these qualities were essential in anarchic conditions. Additionally, the model created a moral responsibility for rulers, as they were believed to be divinely mandated to govern in a manner that satisfies heaven.</p>

                      <h1>The Patriarchal Approach as the Origin of the State</h1>
<p>The principal exponent of this model is Sir Henry Maine. According to him, the city is a conglomeration of several families that developed under the control and authority of the eldest male member of the family. The head or father of the patriarchal family wielded great power and influence over the other members of the family, with his control being exercised within the household. This patriarchal family was the most ancient organized social institution in primitive society. Through the process of marriage, the families began to expand and gave birth to a gens, which refers to a household. Several gens made up one clan, and a group of clans constituted a tribe. A confederation of various tribes, based on blood relations for the purpose of defending themselves against aggressors, formed one commonwealth, which is called the state.</p>

<p>Edward Jenks, another advocate of the patriarchal theory, believes that the foundation of the state was caused by three factors: male kinship, permanent marriages, and paternal authority. Thus, a salient feature of the patriarchal theory is that families grew through the descendants of the father, not the mother. The male child carried on the population through marriages with one or several women, as polygamy was common. The eldest male child had both monogamous and polygamous roles within the household. Another important supporter of this theory was Aristotle, who stated, “Just as men and women unite to form families, so many families unite to form villages, and the union of many villages forms the state, which is a self-supporting unit.”</p>

<h2>Criticism of the Patriarchal Approach to the State</h2>
<p>The patriarchal theory as the origin of the state is subjected to the following criticisms:</p>
<ol>
    <li>First, the origin of the state is due to several factors such as family, religion, force, and political necessity. By identifying the origin of the state solely with the family, one falls into the fallacy of attributing it to a single cause. J. C. Frazer remarked, “Human society is built up by a complexity of causes.”</li>
    <li>Second, the theory is incorrect because several critics believe the primary social unit was a matriarchal family rather than a patriarchal family. According to McLennan and Morgan, staunch supporters of the theory of matriarchy, the matriarchal family and polyandry were the basis of the state.</li>
    <li>Third, the patriarchal theory is built on the erroneous premise that the patriarchal family was the origin of the state. Edward Jenks suggested the correct theory that the tribe, rather than the family, was the beginning of the state based on his studies in Australia.</li>
    <li>Fourth, Sir Henry Maine oversimplified the origin of the state by attributing it solely to the family. This oversimplification is a reason for rejecting the theory as untenable. The authority of the father over the children is only temporary, as his authority ends when the children reach maturity, while the authority of the state over the population is perpetual.</li>

                        <h1>The Matriarchal Approach as the Origin of the State</h1>
<p>The chief exponents of the matriarchal theory are Morgan, McLennan, and Edward Jenks. According to this approach, in primitive society, instead of permanent marriage, there was a sort of sexual anarchy. Under these conditions, the mother, rather than the father, was the head of the family. Kinship was established through the mother.</p>

<p>Edward Jenks, who conducted a thorough study of the tribes of Australia, concluded that these tribes were organized in groups known as totem groups. Their affinity was not based on blood relationships but through symbols like trees or animals. In one totem group, men were to marry all the women of another totem group, leading to practices of both polyandry and polygamy.</p>

<h2>Criticism of the Matriarchal Approach</h2>
<p>The matriarchal theory is criticized on the following grounds:</p>
<ol>
    <li>First, the state was created by several factors, of which the family is just one. This theory makes only a partial study of the origin of the state, as force, religion, politics, and contracts also contributed to its growth.</li>
    <li>Secondly, similar to the patriarchal theory, this approach mistakenly analyzes the origin of the family as the origin of the state. The state is something more than an expanded family; they are quite different in essence, organization, functions, and purposes.</li>
    <li>Thirdly, the theory is historically false. It is not a fact of history that the matriarchal system was the only system at a particular time. In fact, both patriarchal and matriarchal systems coexisted, with a parallel development of both systems.</li>

                       <h1>Force Approach on the Origin of the State</h1>
<p>The exponents of this model hold that wars and aggressions by powerful tribes were the principal factors in the creation of the state. They rely on the oft-quoted saying, “war begot the King,” as the historical explanation of the origin of the state. In primitive society, force or might prevailed over right.</p>

<p>A man physically stronger established his authority over the less strong individuals. Therefore, the strongest person in a tribe became the chief or leader. After establishing the state by subjugating the other people in that area, the chief used his authority to maintain law and order and defend the state from external aggression. Force was responsible not only for the origin of the state but also for its development.</p>

<p>History supports the force theory as the origin of the state. As the state increased in population and size, there was a concomitant improvement in the art of warfare. Small states fought among themselves, and the successful ones became larger states. Historical examples include the kingdoms of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, which were created by the use of force. Similarly, Spain emerged as a new state in the sixth century A.D., and in the ninth century A.D., the Normans conquered and established the state of Russia.</p>

<h2>The Origin of the Force Theory of the State</h2>
<p>The theory is based on the well-accepted maxim of survival of the fittest. There is always a natural struggle for existence, seen in the animal world, and this analogy can be extended to humans. Additionally, by emphasizing the spiritual aspect of the church, clergymen condemned the authority of the state as one of brute force, lending credence to the force theory as a foundational element of the state.</p>

<p>Furthermore, socialists, by condemning the coercive power of the state as one that exploits workers, admit that force is a basis of the state. German philosophers such as Friedrich Hegel, Immanuel Kant, and John Bernhardi support this view, maintaining that war and force are deciding factors in the creation of the state, defining the state as the public power of offense and defense. Bernhardi stated, “Might is the supreme right, and the dispute as to what is right is decided by the arbitrement of war,” suggesting that war provides a biologically just decision based on the nature of things.</p>

<h2>Criticisms of the Force Theory</h2>
<p>The following criticisms are leveled against the theory of force:</p>
<ol>
    <li>First, the element of force is not the only factor in the origin of the state; religion, politics, family, and the process of evolution also contribute. To claim that force is the sole origin commits the fallacy of attributing one cause to something that is influenced by multiple factors.</li>
    <li>Second, the theory of force contradicts the widely accepted maxim, “Will, not force, is the basis of the state.”</li>
    <li>Third, the theory of force is inconsistent with individual liberty. If force is accepted as the basis of a state, how can liberty exist within that framework?</li>
    <li>Fourth, the doctrine of survival of the fittest, relied upon by proponents of the force theory, incorrectly applies a system relevant to the animal world to humans. If force were the determining factor, many peaceful movements would not have triumphed over brute imperialist force.</li>
    <li>Lastly, the force theory should be rejected because political consciousness, rather than force, is the true origin of the state. Without the political consciousness of the people, a state cannot be created, as humans are by nature political animals.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Merits of the Force Theory</h2>
<p>Despite being untenable as a sole explanation for the origin of the state, the theory of force has some redeeming features:</p>
<ol>
    <li>First, the theory acknowledges that some states at certain times were indeed created or brought into existence by force.</li>
    <li>Secondly, it highlights the importance of building adequate defenses and armies to protect the territorial integrity of the state. This is why ancient kingdoms had commanders of war, and modern states allocate substantial budgets for defense, with a dedicated defense minister recognizing the role of force in contemporary statecraft.</li>

                       <h1>The Social Contract Approach</h1>
<p>The most famous theory regarding the origin of the state is the social contract theory. This theory posits that the state came into existence out of a contract between the people and the sovereign at some point in time.</p>

<p>According to this theory, there are two divisions in human history: one period prior to the establishment of the state called the “state of nature,” and the other subsequent to the foundation of the state, known as “civil society.” In the state of nature, society, government, and political authority were absent; there were no laws to regulate the relations among people.</p>

<p>Three main exponents of this theory are Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. They differed in their views about life in the state of nature, the reasons for transitioning to civil society, and the terms of the contract. However, they all agreed that a stage came in human history when the state of nature was exchanged for civil society, leading to a regulated life under political authority.</p>

<p>The net result of this transition was that the people gained security of life and property and social security but lost the natural liberty they enjoyed in the state of nature. The crux of the social contract theory is that men create government to secure their pre-existing natural rights; rights come first, and government is created to protect these rights.</p>

<h2>John Locke's Perspective</h2>
<p>According to John Locke, prior to the establishment of society, men lived in a “state of nature.” Thomas Hobbes, an anti-democratic philosopher, emphasized that in the state of nature, there was no government to make and enforce laws, leading men to war against each other. He characterized life as “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” In contrast, Locke argued that even in the state of nature, a law governed conduct known as “natural law,” which comprised universal principles of right and wrong known to men through reason.</p>

<p>Locke believed that if an Englishman met a Frenchman on an uninhabited and ungoverned island, he would not be free to deprive the Frenchman of his life, liberty, or property. Doing so would violate natural law and lead to punishment. For Locke, the state of nature was not lawless but rather inconvenient. Each man had to protect his rights, and there was no agreed-upon judge to settle disputes regarding natural law. Recognizing this, men decided to make a “compact” to create a government equipped to enforce natural law. Thus, every man agreed to abide by the majority’s decisions and comply with the laws enacted by the people’s representatives, provided those laws did not encroach upon his fundamental rights.</p>

<h2>Thomas Hobbes’s Approach</h2>
<p>In his book <em>Leviathan</em>, Thomas Hobbes delineates the creation of the state through an agreement. Before the state was created, there was a state of nature characterized by war and a lack of law or justice. Human life was marked by force and deceit; might made right. Hobbes depicted a gloomy state of nature with his famous description, “Solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, short.”</p>

<p>The people, fed up with the state of nature, entered into an agreement to establish a government or authority to which they surrendered all their rights unconditionally and irrevocably. This authority was a single person or a group endowed with unlimited power. The authority to rule stemmed from the contract, and the people had no right to depose or agitate against the ruler. Revolting against the authority would be seen as a violation of the contract, leading to a return to the state of nature.</p>

<p>Hobbes viewed the creation of the state and the establishment of government as one single contract. If the state ceased to exist, the government would also vanish. Hobbes referred to his state as Leviathan, which emerged when individuals renounced their powers to exercise the laws of nature, pledging to obey the laws created by the sovereign.</p>

<h2>Locke’s Approach</h2>
<p>In his book <em>Treatise on Civil Government</em>, John Locke adopted the idea of limited government. Unlike Hobbes, Locke viewed the state of nature as one of peace, reason, and goodwill. The people abandoned the state of nature for different reasons, creating civil society through a contract and subsequently establishing a government. In Locke’s view, the ruler was a party to this contract, and the people would obey him as long as he protected their life and property.</p>

<p>Thus, Locke's theory comprises two contracts: one for the creation of civil society and another for the establishment of government. The people’s surrender of rights was partial and conditional; if the government violated the contract, the people had the right to depose the ruler. Locke supported the Glorious Revolution of 1688, emphasizing that his sovereign was political rather than legal, unlike Hobbes, and distinguished between government and state.</p>

<h2>Rousseau’s Theory of Social Contract</h2>
<p>Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in his book <em>Social Contract</em>, published in 1762, reconciled the authority of the state with individual liberty. His depiction of the state of nature was one of idyllic happiness, where human lives were free, healthy, honest, and happy. However, with population growth and the emergence of private property, natural equality among men was destroyed.</p>

<p>To escape this degradation, men entered into an agreement pledging, “Each of us puts his own person and all his powers in common under the supreme direction of the General Will.” In contrast to Hobbes and Locke, the authority created was retained by the whole community rather than given to a ruler. The community expressed the General Will in public meetings, and subsequently, the government was created through legislative measures. Rousseau’s central concept is the “General Will.”</p>

<h2>Rousseau’s General Will</h2>
<p>Rousseau stood for popular sovereignty, contrasting with Hobbes’ legal sovereignty and Locke’s political sovereignty. In Rousseau’s view, political authority, arrived at through the social contract, resided not with the King but with the people themselves. The General Will does not equate to the whole population; rather, it represents the filtered cream of the will of all, reflecting the common interest or welfare of the people. Enlightened public opinion, according to Rousseau, embodies the general will, referred to as “will for the general good.” In practice, this often means the majority opinion of the people.</p>

<p>In contrast to Hobbes, whose contract resulted in an unconditional surrender of rights to an absolute monarch, Locke’s contract involved a conditional delegation of power to a King accountable to the people. Rousseau was more radical, placing the people as the ultimate rulers. Thus, while Hobbes advocated for legal sovereignty, Locke supported political sovereignty, and Rousseau championed popular sovereignty. According to Rousseau, the essential ingredient of the social contract was the “general will,” to which individuals agreed to submit, making the popular sovereign the embodiment of this will.</p>

<h2>Criticism of the Social Contract Approach</h2>
<p>The social contract theory faces strong criticism on several grounds:</p>
<ol>
    <li>First, there is no historical record to support the theory; no evidence exists that such a contract was made. The state existed before it was purported to be created, or the people had some knowledge of the state and government prior to the supposed contract.</li>
    <li>Second, Sir Henry Maine criticized the theory as putting the cart before the horse, arguing that the contract is not the beginning of society but rather its end. The accepted view is that society evolves from the state to contract, not the other way around.</li>
    <li>Third, there cannot be any rights, even natural rights, without the state; rights originate from the state. Without an established civil society, rights cannot exist.</li>
    <li>Fourth, the theory overlooks the historical fact that the state emerged from a long process of growth and development, ignoring other contributing factors.</li>
    <li>Fifth, the theory erroneously implies that the state is a creation of humans when it is, in fact, an independent social institution. This perspective risks inciting revolution by overemphasizing human agency in state creation. The truth is that it is the government, not the state, that is a creation of man.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Value of the Social Contract Approach</h2>
<p>Although the social contract theory is unacceptable as an explanation of the origin of the state, it has some merits:</p>
<ol>
    <li>First, it challenges the less credible theory that the state was created by God. While there may not be historical evidence of a social contract, the theory promotes the idea of popular sovereignty in governance and discourages arbitrary government actions.</li>
    <li>Second, the theory contributed to the development of the modern concept of sovereignty.</li>
    <li>Third, Locke provided critical insights by clearly distinguishing the state from the government.</li>
    <li>Fourth, Rousseau's concept of popular sovereignty inspired many around the world to overthrow oppressive rulers.</li>

                        <h1>Marxist Approach on the Origin of the State</h1>
<p>The Marxists are of the view that the state is a creation by the class struggle with the help of force. So it is altogether a different theory of origin of state with the recognition of force.</p>
<p>The Marxists began with the primitive society where there was no surplus wealth to quarrel with and so there was no state. With the passing of time, society was getting split over hostile classes with conflicting interests. This class antagonism was the root cause of the state.</p>
<p>When agriculture was learned as an art of culture there was ample food which resulted in a private property. The insoluble contradictions as a result of the division of labor became so acute that it was not possible for any class to keep reconciled in the state or to keep the quarreling classes under control.</p>
<p>The most dominant class that controlled the mode of production came to establish the state to ensure its dominance over the other classes that did not own the modes of production. The state thus became an instrument of domination and oppression of one class over the other classes.</p>
<p>Thus the state came in to ensure the right of the dominant class to exploit the other classes. As the dominant classes kept on changing hands so also changed the character of the state. The break-up of the social order followed class conflict which the society became powerless to dispel.</p>
<p>The state was the medium of the economically dominant classes. Lenin developed on the above thesis by bringing the communist party as the dominant class, namely the proletariat and his state, namely the USSR where the proletariat was the dominant class which was to exploit the other classes. Lenin also emphasised on the element of force to be resorted to by the proletariat against the bourgeois. Thus Lenin incorporated the element of force too in the creation of the state.</p>
<p>The Italian Marxist, Antonio Gramsci made a little departure from the Marxist tenet by stating that a state is the creation of the political party that holds on power.</p>

<h2>Criticism of the Marxist Approach to the Origin of State</h2>
<p>The Marxist theory of the origin of the state as based on class struggle is subjected to the following fierce criticism:</p>
<ol>
    <li>In the first place, it is nowhere stated in history that the state in its origin is linked with the class struggle.</li>
    <li>In the second place, there might be different class interests, but it is difficult to say that these classes were at arms as the Marxists have us believe. The classes, on the other hand, cooperated with each other and contributed in their way to the composite development of the state.</li>
    <li>In third place, the Marxist theory is not original, but secondly, it carries the old wine of the force theory in a new Marxist bottle. Force has been discarded as an unsatisfactory theory in the creation of the state.</li>
    <li>In the fourth place, Lenin and Gramsci, by identifying the state with the political party, have erred by generalizing the communist state as an example for all other states. The communist state in Russia and China might have originated with the communist party. Russia and China were already there in the map of the world. They were not created with the communist party. Today communist party is over in Russia. Does it deny the statehood to Russia?</li>
    <li>In the fifth place, Marxism, by identifying the state with the party, encourages the totalitarianism of the worst type like Fascism and Nazism. So the theory is a dangerous one.</li>
    <li>Lastly, the Marxist dogma that the state is a creation of the class and it will die with the death of class is false and misleading. The states are permanent and no state withered away for want of a class to back it.</li>

                       <h2>Minimal State</h2>
<p>The minimal state is the ideal of classical liberals, whose aim is to ensure that individuals enjoy the widest possible realm of freedom. This view is rooted in social-contract theory.</p>
<p>The value of the state is that it has the capacity to constrain human behavior and thus prevent individuals from encroaching on the rights and liberties of others. The state is merely a protective body, its core function being to provide a framework of peace and social order within which citizens can conduct their lives as they think best. In Locke’s famous simile, the state acts as a night watchman, whose services are called upon only when orderly existence is threatened.</p>
<p>This nevertheless leaves the ‘minimal’ or ‘night watchman’ state with three core functions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>First and foremost, the state exists to maintain domestic order.</li>
    <li>Second, it ensures that contracts or voluntary agreements made between private citizens are enforced.</li>
    <li>Third, it provides protection against external attack.</li>
</ol>
<p>The institutional apparatus of a minimal state is thus limited to the police force, a court system, and a military. Economic, social, cultural, moral, and other responsibilities belong to the individual and are therefore firmly part of civil society. State intervention is seen as a ‘dead hand’ that reduces competition, efficiency, and productivity.</p>
<p>From the New Right perspective, the state’s economic role should be confined to two functions: the maintenance of a stable means of exchange or ‘sound money’ (low or zero inflation), and the promotion of competition through controls on monopoly power, price fixing, and so on.</p>

                        <h2>Developmental States</h2>
<p>The best historical examples of minimal states were those in countries such as the UK and the USA during the period of early industrialization in the nineteenth century. In Japan and Germany, for instance, the state assumed a more active ‘developmental’ role from the outset.</p>
<p>A developmental state is one that intervenes in economic life with the specific purpose of promoting industrial growth and economic development. This does not amount to an attempt to replace the market with a ‘socialist’ system of planning and control but, rather, to an attempt to construct a partnership between the state and major economic interests, often underpinned by conservative and nationalist priorities.</p>
<p>The classic example of a developmental state is Japan. During the Meiji Period (1868–1912), the Japanese state forged a close relationship with the Zaibatsu, the great family-run business empire that dominated the Japanese economy up until World War II. Since 1945, the developmental role of the Japanese state has been assumed by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), which, together with the Bank of Japan, helps to shape private investment decisions and steer the Japanese economy towards international competitiveness.</p>
<p>A similar model of developmental intervention has existed in France, where governments of both left and right have tended to recognize the need for economic planning, and the state bureaucracy has seen itself as the custodian of the national interest.</p>

                        <h2>Social Democratic (Welfare) States</h2>
<p>Whereas developmental states practice interventionism in order to stimulate economic progress, social-democratic states intervene with a view to bringing about broader social restructuring, usually in accordance with principles such as fairness, equality, and social justice.</p>
<p>In countries such as Austria and Sweden, state intervention has been guided by both developmental and social democratic priorities.</p>
<p>In a social-democratic state, there is a shift from a ‘negative’ view of the state, which sees it as little more than a necessary evil, to a positive view of the state, in which it is seen as a means of enlarging liberty and promoting justice.</p>
<p>The social-democratic state is thus the ideal of both modern liberals and democratic socialists. Rather than merely laying down the conditions of orderly existence, the social-democratic state is an active participant; in particular, helping to rectify the imbalances and injustices of a market economy.</p>
<p>It, therefore, tends to focus less on the generation of wealth and more on what is seen as the equitable or just distribution of wealth. It is aimed to eradicate poverty and reduce social inequality.</p>
<p>The twin features of a social democratic state are therefore Keynesianism and social welfare. The aim of Keynesian economic policies is to ‘manage’ or ‘regulate’ capitalism with a view to promoting growth and maintaining full employment.</p>
<p>The adoption of welfare policies has led to the emergence of so-called ‘welfare states’, whose responsibilities have extended to the promotion of social well-being amongst their citizens.</p>

                       <h2>Collectivized States</h2>
<p>While developmental and social-democratic states intervene in economic life with a view to guiding or supporting a largely private economy, collectivized states bring the entirety of economic life under state control.</p>
<p>The best examples of such states were in communist countries such as the USSR and throughout Eastern Europe. These states sought to abolish private enterprise altogether and set up centrally planned economies administered by a network of economic ministries and planning committees.</p>
<p>‘Command economies’ were therefore established that were organized through a system of ‘directive’ planning that was ultimately controlled by the highest organs of the communist party.</p>
<p>The justification for state collectivization stems from a fundamental socialist preference for common ownership over private property. The use of the state to attain this goal suggests a more positive attitude to state power than that outlined in the classical writings of Marx and Engels (1820–95).</p>

                        <h2>Totalitarian States</h2>
<p>Totalitarian states represent the most extreme and extensive form of state interventionism. The essence of totalitarianism lies in the construction of an all-embracing state, whose influence penetrates every aspect of human existence, effectively dictating the lives of its citizens.</p>

<p>In a totalitarian regime, the state exerts control over not only the economy but also essential social institutions such as education, culture, religion, and family life. This comprehensive control aims to shape individuals' beliefs, values, and behaviors according to the state's ideology.</p>

<p>Historical examples of totalitarian states include Hitler’s Nazi Germany and Stalin’s Soviet Union. Modern regimes, such as Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, also exhibit characteristics reminiscent of totalitarianism. These regimes are marked by several central pillars:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Surveillance:</strong> A comprehensive system of monitoring citizens to prevent dissent and maintain control.</li>
    <li><strong>Terroristic Policing:</strong> The use of state-sanctioned violence and intimidation to suppress opposition and instill fear.</li>
    <li><strong>Ideological Manipulation:</strong> A pervasive system that promotes state-approved ideologies, often through propaganda, education, and censorship.</li>
</ul>

<p>Totalitarian states effectively extinguish civil society, abolishing the private sphere of life altogether. This eradication of individual autonomy and dissent is a fundamental characteristic of totalitarian regimes.</p>

<p>This goal of total state control is openly endorsed by fascists, who seek to dissolve individual identity within the collective social whole. As such, totalitarianism poses significant challenges to the fundamental principles of democracy, human rights, and personal freedom.</p>

                       <h2>Religious States</h2>
<p>In an era marked by the increasing march of secularization, the concept of a religious state may appear to be a contradiction in terms. In the United States, the secular nature of the state is enshrined in the First Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees that freedom of worship shall not be abridged. Similarly, France has maintained a strict separation of church and state through its principle of <em>laïcité</em>, or secularism.</p>

<p>In countries like Norway, Denmark, and the United Kingdom, established or state religions have developed; however, their political influence is generally limited due to a high level of social secularization. Despite this trend, the period since the 1980s has witnessed a notable rise of the religious state.</p>

<p>Fundamentalist movements, far from viewing the political realm as inherently corrupt, have often sought to seize control of the state and use it as an instrument for moral and spiritual regeneration. Examples of this phenomenon include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Pakistan:</strong> The process of <em>Islamization</em> initiated under General Zia-ul-Haq after 1978, which aimed to embed Islamic principles into the political and legal systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Iran:</strong> The establishment of an <em>Islamic state</em> following the 1979 revolution, which transformed the country’s political landscape and governance based on religious tenets.</li>
    <li><strong>Sri Lanka:</strong> Despite its formal commitment to secularism, the close ties between the Sri Lankan state and Buddhism were particularly evident during the years of violent struggle against Tamil separatism.</li>
</ul>

<p>This increasing prominence of religious states raises critical questions about the balance between religious beliefs and secular governance, as well as the implications for democracy and individual rights.</p>

                       <h1 style="font-size: 2.5em; text-align: center;">Classification of Government</h1>

<p>Government can be classified on the basis of its function, distribution of power in the central and centrifugal forces, type, and the relationship between the legislative and executive branches. On the basis of what it does, the government can be classified as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Legislative</li>
    <li>Executive</li>
    <li>Judiciary</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legislative (Law-Making) Organ</h2>
<p>It is the supreme law-making organ of the government. It has different names: Parliament, Assembly, Congress, etc. The legislative organ may differ from state to state depending on the number of houses. Some legislative organs of government are bicameral and others are unicameral, having two houses and a single house respectively.</p>
<p>Bicameral parliaments are introduced to provide check and balance within the legislature. For example, the USA has a bicameral legislature (the House of Representatives + the Senate). The two houses check each other in their activities.</p>
<p>Federal states are basically characterized by the existence of a bicameral parliament.</p>
<p>Countries with bicameral parliament:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Canada</li>
    <li>USA (1st house=the House of People’s Representatives, 2nd house=the Senate)</li>
    <li>Ethiopia (1st house=the House of Peoples’ Representatives, 2nd house=the House of Federation)</li>
    <li>Britain (1st house=the House of Commons, 2nd house= the House of Lords)</li>
    <li>Australia</li>
    <li>India</li>
</ul>

<p>Members of the 1st house are directly elected by the public whereas members of the second house could be nominated by a concerned body. Unicameral parliament is common in unitary states. It is adopted to avoid duplication of activities and services, and to have a clear responsibility of one body.</p>
<p>Countries with unicameral parliament:</p>
<ul>
    <li>China</li>
    <li>Bulgaria</li>
    <li>Denmark</li>
    <li>Kenya</li>
    <li>Algeria</li>
    <li>Costa Rica</li>
    <li>Finland</li>
    <li>Tanzania</li>
</ul>

<h3>Powers and Functions of the Legislative Organ of Government</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Law-making (legislation):</strong> Law-making is the primary function of the legislative organ of the government. It is responsible to draft, amend (modify), and ratify (endorse) public laws, policies, and decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Control over administration:</strong> In parliamentary systems, the executive is accountable to the legislative branch of the government.</li>
    <li><strong>Amending the constitution:</strong> The legislative organ of the government has the power and responsibility to amend (modify) the constitution.</li>
    <li><strong>Elect and depose the executive (the Prime Minister):</strong> The legislative organ plays a key role in the political landscape.</li>
    <li><strong>Financial function:</strong> Endorse decisions on the government budget proposed by the executive organ of the government.</li>
    <li><strong>Investigative function:</strong> Digging up and collecting information through the establishment of different standing committees and commissions of inquiries.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Executive Organ of Government</h2>
<p>In many countries, the term government connotes only the executive branch. But this is wrong, because it excludes the two branches. The executive organ of the government is responsible for the daily administrative and management of the state bureaucracy. It is also responsible for the implementation of laws and policies of the state.</p>
<p>The executive organ of the government is a complex organ that consists of the head of state and government, ministers, and other enforcing bodies of the government.</p>

<h3>Powers and Functions of the Executive Organ of Government</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Execution of national policies:</strong> The executive organ gives general direction for national policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Supervision of implementation:</strong> The executive organizes and mobilizes the public for effective implementation of national policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Controlling the military (defense forces):</strong> The executive is responsible for maintaining peace and stability of the state.</li>
    <li><strong>Conducting foreign relations:</strong> Foreign policy formulation and implementation are the responsibilities of the executive.</li>
    <li><strong>Providing leadership:</strong> The executive provides both ceremonial and effective leadership.</li>
    <li><strong>Decision-making in crises:</strong> The executive takes swift action in crisis situations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Judiciary Organ of Government</h2>
<p>The judiciary is primarily concerned with the interpretation of laws. It is empowered to decide legal disputes and adjudicate the meaning of laws.</p>
<p>The judiciary organ is responsible for interpreting laws, including the constitution and other laws of the country. In Ethiopia, the power to interpret the constitution is given to the House of Federation.</p>

<h3>Powers and Functions of the Judiciary</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Adjudication:</strong> Administers justice through court systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Formation of case laws:</strong> Sometimes the judiciary formulates laws when delegated law-making power.</li>
    <li><strong>Protection of the constitution:</strong> The judiciary ensures all laws conform to the constitution.</li>
    <li><strong>Judicial review:</strong> Reviews acts and decisions of legislative and executive organs for constitutional validity.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Unitary:</strong> A form of government where power is concentrated in a central authority, with limited autonomy given to regional or local authorities.</li>
    <li><strong>Federal:</strong> A form of government that divides power between a central authority and smaller political units, such as states or provinces, allowing them to exercise significant autonomy.</li>
    <li><strong>Confederal:</strong> A form of government in which independent states or regions unite for certain purposes while retaining most of their sovereignty, typically leading to a weak central authority.</li>

                       <h1 style="font-size: 2.5em; text-align: center;">The Unitary Government</h1>
<p>The unitary state structure is a political structure where the national government entirely controls the sub-national units. It is characterized by:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A political structure in which the central government is the only source of authority within the state.</li>
    <li>A political structure in which the central government is legally supreme over the local governments.</li>
    <li>A political structure where sovereignty and law-making activities are indivisible.</li>
</ul>

<p>A unitary system accords its component areas little or no autonomy; most governance is done from the capital city. In this regard, unitary governments have significant control over local authorities. Local governments are agents of the central government, established for the purpose of implementing the laws and policies framed by the central government.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Features of a Unitary Government</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Supremacy of Central Legislature:</strong> The central legislature (parliament) is absolutely supreme in making laws, while local units are obliged to implement them.</li>
    <li><strong>Absence of Subsidiary Law-Making Sovereign Bodies:</strong> The national government is the only body responsible for making laws.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Governments Can Be Created or Abolished by the Central Government:</strong> Their existence is determined by the will and interest of the central government.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Governments Are Weak:</strong> They do not have the power to make their own laws, policies, or financial decisions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Rationale for Opting for a Unitary System of Government</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Homogeneous Society:</strong> Societies with similar language, ethnicity, culture, and history can have uniform laws and policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Small Territory:</strong> A small and manageable territory makes it easier for the central government to control peripheral areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although unitary states share common features, they differ in the degree of centralization of power and authority. Based on their interaction with local governments, unitary states are classified into two categories:</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Types of Unitary Government</h2>
<h3>Centralized (Concentrated) Unitary System</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Characterized by the absence of devolution of power; local governments do not have political power to make decisions on socio-economic and political affairs.</li>
    <li>Local governments are highly regulated by the central government and are established to implement central policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Bulgaria, France, the Netherlands, Japan, and Poland.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Decentralized Unitary Government</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Involves the delegation of power to local units, though such delegation is not constitutionally supported.</li>
    <li>Local governments may have decision-making autonomy, including some legislative powers granted by the central government.</li>
    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> China grants regional autonomy to Tibet; in the UK, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland are autonomous regions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Merits of a Unitary System of Government</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Effective and efficient political structure; the central government can swiftly respond to situations.</li>
    <li>Flexible; the central government can amend its structure as needed.</li>
    <li>Promotes uniformity in administration and legislation.</li>
    <li>Less expensive due to reduced duplication in legislation, administration, and adjudication.</li>
    <li>Avoids conflicts of jurisdiction among different levels of government.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Demerits of a Unitary Government</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Suitable for autocratic governments as all powers are centralized.</li>
    <li>Discourages local government initiatives due to its top-down approach.</li>
    <li>May lack adequate knowledge of local situations.</li>
    <li>The central government is burdened with all activities at both national and local levels.</li>
    <li>Not suitable for territorially large states.</li>
</ul>

                       <h1 style="font-size: 2.5em; text-align: center;">The Federal State Structure</h1>
<p>Federalism refers to a spatial or territorial division of power between two or more levels of government in a given political system. It is characterized by:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A state in which two levels of government rule the same land and people, with each level having at least one area of action in which it is autonomous.</li>
    <li>A constitutional guarantee of the autonomy of each government in its own sphere.</li>
    <li>A political organization where the activities of government are divided between regional governments and a central government, ensuring that each kind has some areas for final decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<p>Federalism can be achieved in two ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>“Coming together” federation:</strong> Occurs when sovereign states decide to form a federation voluntarily for reasons such as security and governmental efficiency.</li>
    <li><strong>“Holding together” federation:</strong> Emerges after consensual parliamentary decisions to maintain a unitary state by establishing a multi-ethnic federal system to avoid or settle conflicts.</li>
</ul>

<p>While there are many forms of federalism, they fundamentally involve self-rule and shared rule. Here are the basic features of a federal system:</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Basic Features of a Federal System</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Existence of Dual Governments:</strong> Federal and regional governments with their own separate constitutions.</li>
    <li><strong>Absence of Unilateral Centralization:</strong> The central/federal government cannot centralize powers and authority at its will.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent Required for Constitutional Amendments:</strong> Amendments to the federal constitution require the agreement of sub-national/regional governments.</li>
    <li><strong>Supremacy of Federal Constitution:</strong> Regional constitutions must align with the federal constitution, which is the ultimate authority.</li>
    <li><strong>Supremacy of Federal Government:</strong> Key activities such as military, foreign policy, and state emergency management are responsibilities of the federal government.</li>
    <li><strong>Recognized Power of Regional States:</strong> Regional states are autonomous bodies and cannot be dictated by the federal government.</li>
    <li><strong>Existence of Written Constitution:</strong> All federal states have written constitutions that specify the powers of the central and regional governments.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Powers in a Federal System</h2>
<p>Federalism includes exclusive powers for both levels of government:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Exclusive Powers of the Federal Government:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Conducting foreign relations</li>
            <li>Organizing and controlling defense forces</li>
            <li>Printing and circulating money</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Exclusive Powers of the Constituent Units:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Provision and management of education, health, and labor affairs</li>
            <li>Promotion and management of transport and communication</li>
            <li>Realizing internal security</li>
            <li>Agriculture, industry, trade, and tourism</li>
            <li>Managing local finance (raising and spending)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Residual Powers:</strong> Powers not explicitly given to any level of government; in Ethiopia, these are given to regional governments (Article 51 of the FDRE constitution).</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Merits of a Federal System of Government</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Suitable for territorially vast states and diverse societies.</li>
    <li>Maintains balance between centrifugal and centripetal forces.</li>
    <li>Grants self-government and self-determination for people to manage their affairs.</li>
    <li>Increases citizen participation in public decision-making through local and central bodies.</li>
    <li>Local and regional governments are closer to the people, ensuring responsiveness to specific community needs.</li>
    <li>Minimizes inefficiency and bureaucratic chaos by preventing overload on the central government.</li>
    <li>Combines national unity with local autonomy, balancing the forces in a state.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Demerits of a Federal System of Government</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Creates unnecessary complexity and confusion due to duplication of legislation, administration, and taxation.</li>
    <li>Can be very expensive.</li>
    <li>The division of power may lead to jurisdictional conflicts between national and local officials, resulting in a “No Man’s Land” where neither authority can act decisively.</li>
</ul>

                        <h1 style="font-size: 2.5em; text-align: center;">Confederal Government</h1>
<p>Usually created by a treaty, confederations of states tend to be established for dealing with critical issues, such as defense, foreign relations, internal trade, or currency, with the central government being required to provide support for all its members.</p>

<p>Confederalism represents the main form of intergovernmentalism, which is defined as any form of interaction among states that occurs based on sovereign independence or government. The nature of the relationship among the member states constituting a confederation varies considerably. Likewise, the relationship between the member states and the general government, as well as the distribution of powers among them, can also vary.</p>

<p>Some loose confederations are similar to international organizations, while others with stricter rules may resemble federal systems. Under a confederation, unlike a federal state, the central authority is relatively weak, indicating a loose relationship between the center and the periphery. Decision-making in the general government usually proceeds by consensus (unanimity), not by majority.</p>

<p>Historically, confederalism has served as a transition to a federal system of government, as seen in the American, Swiss, and German cases of regional integration.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Examples of Confederal States</h2>
<p>In terms of internal structure, every confederal state is composed of two or more constituent states, referred to as confederated states. Regarding their political systems, confederated states can have either republican or monarchical forms of government:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Confederated Republics:</strong> Those with a republican form of government are usually called states (like the states of the American Confederacy, 1861-1865) or republics (like the republics of Serbia and Montenegro within the former State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, 2003-2006).</li>
    <li><strong>Confederated Monarchies:</strong> Those with a monarchical form of government are defined by various hierarchical ranks (like the kingdoms of Iraq and Jordan within the Hashemite Arab Union in 1958).</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Notable Examples</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Benelux:</strong> A politico-economic union of the states of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, bound through treaties and based on consensus among the representatives of the member states.</li>
    <li><strong>European Union:</strong> A political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fourth classification of government is based on the relation between the legislative and the executive organs:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Presidential System:</strong> A system of government where the president is the head of state and government, separate from the legislative branch.</li>
    <li><strong>Parliamentary System:</strong> A system where the executive derives its democratic legitimacy from, and is directly accountable to, the legislature (parliament).</li>
    <li><strong>Mixed System:</strong> A hybrid system that incorporates elements of both presidential and parliamentary systems, allowing for shared powers and responsibilities.</li>
</ul>

                        <h1 style="font-size: 2.5em; text-align: center;">Parliamentarian System of Government</h1>
<p>The executive organ of government is accountable to the legislative organ of government. For example, in Ethiopia, the prime minister and the council of ministers collectively and separately are accountable to the House of Peoples’ Representatives.</p>

<p>When a government or the executive loses the confidence of the parliament, there is always the possibility of new elections. If a prime minister loses confidence in the parliament, he/she can be deposed by the parliament through the motion of the vote of no confidence. This is not so clearly the case in presidential systems, where presidential impeachment is possible but generally requires evidence of wrongdoing rather than mere unpopularity or policy failure. For example, Mrs. Thatcher was removed as a prime minister in 1990 by the British Conservative Party in parliament because of policy failure, although there was no suggestion of wrongdoing.</p>

<p>For stable government to be possible, the executive or the government must be able to control the legislature (parliament). If it cannot do so, then either the government changes or the parliament is dissolved and new elections will be held.</p>

<p><strong>Party Discipline:</strong> In parliamentary systems, there is a chance for the existence of several parties in the parliament. If no party has a majority of seats, two or more parties will form a coalition government.</p>

<p>In parliamentary systems, the head of state (figurehead monarch or weak president) is a distinct office different from the head of government (prime minister or chancellor).</p>

<p>In this system, the prime minister is the important figure. He/she is the chief executive and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The prime minister holds the real executive power. The term of office for the prime minister is not fixed; it depends upon the will of the political party that holds political power or the majority of seats in the parliament.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Parliamentary Systems:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A prime minister can be removed without great upheaval. He/she can be forced out of office if he/she becomes excessively unpopular or loses the support of parliamentary colleagues.</li>
    <li>Avoids dual legislation. In parliamentary systems, voters choose a single legislature, namely, parliament. In presidential systems, however, voters have to choose twice: once to elect the president and once to elect the congress.</li>
    <li>It creates harmony between the executive and legislative branches of the government because the majority of the members of parliament are members of the political party that holds state power.</li>
    <li>The executive branch of the government is accountable to the parliament; hence, there is less possibility of a tendency towards dictatorship.</li>
    <li>Necessarily, the party that secures majority seats organizes a government.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Demerits of Parliamentary Systems:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Violates the principle of separation of powers.</li>
    <li>It can result in unstable government when there is no party that secures majority seats in the parliament.</li>
    <li>There will be a tendency to ignore the interests of the public in order to keep the interests of a political party.</li>
</ul>

                        <h1 style="font-size: 2.5em; text-align: center;">Presidential System of Government</h1>
<p>Presidential systems are systems where the president is not just a figurehead but also a functioning head of government. Presidential democracies most clearly show the separation of power between the executive and legislative branches. In presidential systems, the president is more or less directly elected by the people and is vested with considerable powers, which makes it difficult to oust them by the legislative body.</p>

<p>Presidents in presidential systems are not responsible to legislatures, which means the close connection between the legislative and executive is broken. Presidents are elected on their own and choose cabinet ministers or department secretaries from outside the ranks of the legislative body.</p>

<h2>Common Features of Presidential Systems:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The president is the head of state and government.</li>
    <li>He/she is the commander-in-chief of the national defense forces.</li>
    <li>The office of head of state and the office of head of government are merged in the office of the president.</li>
    <li>The president has veto power over the draft bills presented by the legislative body of the government.</li>
    <li>He/she has parallel power with the legislature.</li>
    <li>The president can be impeached if he/she is found guilty of wrongdoing or crimes.</li>
    <li>The term of office for the president is fixed in presidential systems, unlike prime ministers in parliamentary systems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advantages of Presidential Systems:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The fate of the executive does not depend upon the legislative, ensuring stability of the executive organ.</li>
    <li>It provides better room for checks and balances.</li>
    <li>It minimizes the abuse of power among the organs of the government.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Demerits of Presidential Systems:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Since the president is not accountable to the legislative, this system may lead to autocracy or dictatorship.</li>
    <li>There is a possibility of confrontation between the president and the legislative, especially when one political party wins the office of the president while another party wins the majority of seats in the legislature.</li>
    <li>The president may not be able to influence the legislature to make laws that meet the conditions of a crisis.</li>
</ul>

                        <h1 style="font-size: 2.5em; text-align: center;">Hybrid (Mixed) System</h1>
<p>The hybrid system refers to the combination of both parliamentary and presidential systems. It is also termed a semi-presidential system. In this system, the people (electorate) elect both the legislative members and the president. Following this, the president will appoint the prime minister.</p>

<p>The president holds significant powers, such as controlling the defense forces and managing matters related to foreign affairs. France is often cited as the best example of hybrid systems.</p>

<p>
    Citizenship is a polysemy term which has had different meanings depending on the historical legacies, political organization of the state, ideologies, and socio-cultural context of societies.
</p>
<p>
    Although differences may exist, there are common elements one can find in the definitions of the term:
</p>

<h2>Common Elements of Citizenship</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Citizenship as a Status of Right</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Membership and Identity</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Citizenship as a Status of Rights</h2>
<p>
    The mere fact of being a citizen makes the person a creditor of a series of rights. 
    Marshall (1998) distinguishes three types of rights that historically have been established in succession:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Civil Rights:</strong> Necessary for the development of individual liberty.</li>
    <li><strong>Political Rights:</strong> The right to participate in the exercise of political power, as an elected member or as a voter.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Rights:</strong> Rights that guarantee the right to public safety, health, education, etc., ensuring a decent life.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hohfeldian Incidents</h2>
<p>
    Hohfeld (1978) discovered four components of rights known as ‘the Hohfeldian incidents’ namely:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Liberty (Privilege) Right</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Claim Right</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Power Right</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Immunity Right</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Liberty Right</h3>
<p>
    Liberty rights refer to the freedom given to the right-holder to do something, without obligations on other parties to assist in exercising such rights. 
    No one, including the State, has any legitimate authority to interfere with the citizen’s freedom except to prevent harm to others. 
    For instance, every citizen has the right to movement, limited by another’s claim right. 
    Refer to Articles 25 to 34 of the FDRE Constitution.
</p>

<h3>Claim Rights</h3>
<p>
    Claim rights are the inverse of liberty rights and entail a responsibility upon another person or body. 
    The duty bearer must accomplish something indispensable for right holders to enjoy their claim rights. 
    Unlike liberty rights, claim rights impose corresponding duties on others to respect and protect the bearers.
</p>
<p>
    For example, social rights such as unemployment benefits depend on taxes paid by others. 
    A contract between an employer and employee confers on the employee a right to wages, a claim that the employer has a duty to fulfill. 
    Article 41(3 and 4) of the FDRE Constitution emphasizes the government's responsibility to provide publicly funded social services, as all Ethiopian citizens have the right to enjoy these basic privileges.
</p>

<h3>Power Rights</h3>
<p>
    Power rights pertain to the modification of first-order rights. 
    The holder of a right, whether a government or a citizen, can change or cancel entitlements. 
    Article 40(1) of the FDRE Constitution asserts that Ethiopian citizens have the right to ownership of private property and the ability to modify, sell, donate, or transfer it to a third party.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, Article 33(3) grants every Ethiopian citizen the right to renounce their Ethiopian citizenship/nationality, demonstrating the power rights of citizens. 
    Similarly, a government can modify legal rights by imposing or removing duties from citizens.
</p>

<h3>Immunity Rights</h3>
<p>
    Immunity rights entail the absence of power in another party to alter the right-holder’s normal situation. 
    For instance, civil servants have the right not to be dismissed from their jobs, and a witness in court has the right not to be compelled to incriminate themselves. 
    Article 18(3) of the FDRE Constitution states, “No one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labor.”
</p>
<p>
    Immunities also include compensation for rights violations that occurred in the past, helping to partially address past injustices or uneven burdens.

<h2>Citizenship as Membership and Identity</h2>
<p>
    Citizenship is associated with membership in a political community, which implies integration into that community with a specific identity common to all members who belong to it. 
    The criteria for membership have been linked to shared territory, common culture, ethnic characteristics, history, etc. 
    Those who contribute to the well-being of their community are understood to be the ‘true’ citizens. 
    Conversely, those who free-ride are mere members who do not seem to understand, embrace, or embody what citizenship really means.
</p>

<h2>Citizenship as Participation</h2>
<p>
    Participation occupies a key position in citizenship. 
    Individuals differ in what approaches they find important—some people focus on their private affairs while others actively participate in the life of society, including politics. 
    There are two approaches in this regard: minimalists and maximalists.
</p>
<p>
    A minimalist approach to citizenship is characterized by a kind of basic passive compliance with the rules of a particular community or state, while the maximalist approach implies active, broad participation of citizens engaged in the state. 
    People cannot realize their rights (be it social, economic, or political rights) if they fail to exercise their democratic rights to participate in decision-making that affects, directly or indirectly, their affairs.
</p>

<h2>Citizenship as Inclusion and Exclusion</h2>
<p>
    Not all individuals living in a particular state are necessarily citizens. 
    For instance, there are non-citizens visiting, working, and living in Ethiopia who are branded as foreigners or aliens. 
    Foreigners have the likelihood of staying in the territorial administration of Ethiopia as long as they possess authorized visas. 
    Therefore, aliens have rights similar to those of Ethiopian citizens, such as the right to life, movement, and protection under the law.
</p>
<p>
    There are also responsibilities shared by both non-citizens and citizens residing in Ethiopia, particularly in respecting the laws of the country. 
    However, citizens are fundamentally different from aliens in enjoying privileges and shouldering responsibilities. 
    There are some political and economic rights reserved for and duties to be discharged by citizens only. 
    For instance:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>An Ethiopian citizen has the right to access land.</li>
    <li>Vote and be elected.</li>
    <li>Obtain an Ethiopian passport.</li>
    <li>Defend the constitution as well as Ethiopian territory from foreign aggressors is solely the duty of Ethiopian citizens.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Generally, citizenship as the legal relationship between a person and a state is different from the specific legal relationship that exists between foreigners and the host state.

                       <h1 style="font-size: 2.5em; text-align: center;">Theories of Citizenship</h1>

<p>
    Citizenship is not an eternal essence but rather a cultural artifact molded by people through time. 
    The notion of citizenship and the meaning attached to it change with the evolution of political thoughts, ideologies, policies, and government. 
    For instance, citizenship during monarchical, military, and post-1991 Ethiopia has been framed and defined differently.
</p>

<p>
    Though there are different approaches to citizenship, most contemporary works that address the issue of citizenship speak of the following four approaches: liberal, communitarian, republican, and multicultural citizenship.
</p>

<h2>Citizenship in Liberal Thought</h2>
<p>
    Liberal thought gives strong emphasis to the individual liberty of the citizen and the rights that adhere to each person. 
    In liberalism, the primary political unit as well as the initial focus of all fundamental political inquiry is the individual person. 
    Liberals insist that individuals should be free to decide on their own conception of the good life and applaud the liberation of individuals from any ascribed or inherited status. 
    Individuals conceive of themselves and one another as having the moral power to have a conception of the good.
</p>
<p>
    John Locke (1960), one of the influential early proponents of liberal theory, viewed individuals as endowed with reasoning skills, through which they can discern and act upon the dictates of divinely given natural law. 
    Citizenship cannot be defined based on shared identity or a common culture; the individual chooses his own affections, and any identification with other individuals is rather a product of their legal status as citizens.
</p>

<h3>Critics of the Liberal Theory of Citizenship</h3>
<p>
    First, how can people be kept from killing each other and ruining the foundation of their mutually beneficial relationship? 
    The tragedy of the commons are two of the most common challenges associated with advocating liberalism. 
</p>
<p>
    Second, liberals see the privatization of personality, commitment, and action positively. As a result, the issue is around how individuals and their ideas are framed. 
    Autonomous individuals' tastes and insights could be the result of an impure process. 
</p>
<p>
    Third, as we've seen, individuals have a complete choice to participate in politics or not participate at all. 
    If many citizens are unwilling to dedicate time or attention to politics, power will become an instrument of the few rather than the many, putting the democratic future in jeopardy.
</p>
<p>
    Fourth, inequalities arise from differences in individual skills, values, and choices, and these differences will exacerbate economic and other inequities.
</p>

<h2>Citizenship in Communitarian Thought</h2>
<p>
    Communitarians view individuals as the product of social practices. 
    Communitarianism is an approach that emphasizes the importance of society in articulating the good. 
    Citizens' identities cannot be understood outside of the region in which they reside.
</p>

<h2>Citizenship in Republican Thought</h2>
<p>
    Republican citizenship theory emphasizes both individual and group rights. 
    Unlike communitarians, republicans don’t pressure individuals to surrender their particular identities. 
    Unlike liberalism, republicans maintain that individuals must overcome their personal inclinations and set aside their private interests when necessary to do what is best for the public.
</p>
<p>
    'Republic' derives from the Latin <em>respublica</em>, the public thing, matter, business, or property, with the implication that a republic differs from a state or society in which the rulers regard everything, including the people who inhabit it, as their property.
</p>
<p>
    Republicans draw out from individuals their talents and capacities and draw them together into the community.
</p>

<h3>Critics of the Republican Concept of Citizenship</h3>
<p>
    The republican conception of citizenship is no longer realistic. 
    In practice, republican politicians enforced homogeneity by excluding from citizenship all those defined as different. 
</p>
<p>
    Another point concerns the claim that citizenship involves a false ideal of impartiality.
</p>

<h2>The Multicultural Conception of Citizenship</h2>
<p>
    The rising global immigration has rendered countries multinational, necessitating the need for a multicultural conception of citizenship. 
    This conception emphasizes removing barriers based on gender, sexual preference, age, disability, location, Aboriginality, ethnicity, religion, area of origin, and culture. 
</p>
<p>
    It envisages the need for additional rights for vulnerable minority groups, in order for such groups to sustain themselves amidst the dominant culture. 
    So, multicultural citizenship emphasizes four principles:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Taking equality of citizenship rights as a starting point.</li>

<p>
    Citizenship rights were among the rights guaranteed to individuals by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted in 1948. 
    According to Article 15 of the declaration, “everyone has a right to a nationality” and that “no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality.”

<p>
    Before 1930, there wasn’t an officially inscribed legal document that dealt with citizenship. 
    But in 1930, Ethiopia adopted a legal document named “Ethiopian Nationality Law.” 
    Recently, this nationality law has been replaced by another legal document called “Ethiopian Nationality Proclamation NO. 378/2003,” 
    which was adopted in 2003 by the House of People’s Representatives.
</p>

<p>
    This proclamation is enacted in accordance with articles 6 and 33 of the 1995 FDRE Constitution and affirms that a person can acquire Ethiopian citizenship either by birth or naturalization.

<p>
    An application to obtain Ethiopian nationality by law shall be accompanied by relevant documents and shall be submitted to the Security, Immigration, and Refugee Affairs Authority (Article 10 of the proclamation).
</p>

<p>
    The application shall be examined by the Nationality Affairs Committee (Article 11 and 23 of the proclamation), which comprises five members, namely:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>(I)</strong> A representative of the Security, Immigration, and Refugee Affairs Authority (Chairperson)</li>
    <li><strong>(ii)</strong> A representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Member)</li>
    <li><strong>(iii)</strong> A representative of the Ministry of Justice (Member)</li>
    <li><strong>(iv)</strong> A representative of the Federal Police Commission (Member)</li>
    <li><strong>(v)</strong> A representative of the Authority (Member and Secretary)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The Committee has to submit its recommendation to the Security, Immigration, and Refugee Affairs Authority. If the committee’s recommendation is approved by the Authority, the applicant shall take the oath of allegiance (Article 12 of the proclamation) in front of the committee.
</p>

<p>
    Lastly, the applicant receives a certificate of naturalization and becomes legally an Ethiopian national.
