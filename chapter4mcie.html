        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Dear learners, this chapter discusses the issue of the notion of state, basic features of state, the role of state and the state structure, government types and systems and citizenship. It starts by defining the terms and then proceeds to the dimensions and theories of state, government and citizenship.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Though, there are many theories of on these areas, in this chapter we will focus on the major schools of thoughts and perspectives.

          <p class="italic text-gray-600">Define state? What do you think are the essential features of the state?</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6 text-gray-700">4.3.1 Defining State</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          The term 'state' has been used to refer to a bewildering range of things: a collection of institutions, a territorial unit, a philosophical idea, an instrument of coercion or oppression, and so on. This confusion stems, in part, from the fact that the state has been understood in four quite different ways; from an idealist perspective, a functionalist perspective, an organizational perspective and an international perspective.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">
           The idealist approach to the state is most clearly reflected in the writings of Hegel.
         </p>
       </div>

        <!-- Slide 4: Idealist Approach (Hegel) -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Defining State: Idealist Approach (Hegel)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Hegel identified three moments of social existence: the family, civil society and the state.
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-2">
             <li><strong>Family:</strong> Encourages 'particular altruism' for own children/relatives.</li>
             <li><strong>Civil Society:</strong> Seen as sphere of 'universal egoism' where individuals place own interests before others.</li>
             <li><strong>State:</strong> Conceived as ethical community underpinned by mutual sympathy – 'universal altruism'.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">
          Drawback of idealism: fosters uncritical reverence for the state; fails to distinguish clearly between institutions that are part of the state and those outside it.
         </p>
       </div>

        <!-- Slide 5: Functionalist & Organizational Approaches -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Defining State: Functionalist & Organizational</h2>
         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Functionalist approaches:</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Focus on role/purpose of state institutions. Central function: maintenance of social order. State defined as set of institutions upholding order and delivering stability (adopted by Neo-Marxists). Weakness: tends to associate *any* institution maintaining order (family, mass media, unions, church) with the state itself.
         </p>
         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">The organizational view:</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">
            Defines state as apparatus of government in broadest sense; set of institutions recognizably 'public' (responsible for collective organization, funded publicly). Virtue: distinguishes clearly between state (bureaucracy, military, police, courts, social security system - the 'body politic') and civil society. Allows talking about 'rolling forward' or 'rolling back' the state (expanding/contracting responsibilities).
         </p>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 6: International Approach & Montevideo Features -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Defining State: International Approach & Features</h2>
         <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">The international approach:</p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Views state primarily as actor on world stage; basic 'unit' of international politics. Highlights dualistic structure: inward-looking face (relations with own society) and outward-looking face (relations with other states).
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Classic definition found in <strong>Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of the State (1933)</strong>. Article 1: state has four features:
           <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>A defined territory</li>
              <li>A permanent population</li>
              <li>An effective government</li>
              <li>Sovereignty</li>
           </ol>
         </p>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 7: Features of State: Population -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Features of State: Population</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           <strong>Population:</strong> First essential element. How much population? No exact number. Wide variance (China/India > 1 billion; Vatican/San Marino < few thousand).
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Should population be homogeneous? Determined by common factors (religion, blood, language, culture)? Good for integration, but not essential. Most states heterogeneous; nation building marked by diversity. Problems of nation building solved irrespective of differences.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
             Signifies 'unity in diversity'. Noted that without population there can be no state, 'it goes without saying that an uninhabited portion of the earth, cannot form a state.'
           </p>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 8: Features of State: Territory -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Features of State: Defined Territory</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           No state without territory. Includes land, water, airspace; maritime jurisdiction up to 3 miles (some claim 12-20 miles). Authority extends to ships on high seas under its flag, embassies/legations abroad.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Size not fixed factor. Large states (China, Russia) and small (Fiji, Mauritius). Also possible island states (Indonesia, Philippines, Japan).
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Boundary lines must be well marked out. Can be done geographically (seas, rivers, mountains, forests) or artificially (digging trenches, fixing posts/wire fencing).
          </p>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 9: Features of State: Government -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Features of State: Government</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Said to be soul of the state. Implements state's will. Protects against insecurity. If state regarded as first condition of civilized life, government maintains law/order, makes 'good life' possible. Machinery terminating anarchy.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Universally recognized need for mechanism to bring about/maintain workable arrangement to keep people together. Government should be organized to maintain peace/security.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
             Form may be monarchical, aristocratic, oligarchic, democratic, dictatorial. What really needed is that if no government, there is anarchy and state is at an end.
           </p>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 10: Features of State: Sovereignty -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Features of State: Sovereignty</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Fourth essential attribute. Highest power distinguishing state from other associations. Simplest sense: principle of absolute/unlimited power.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Two aspects:
           <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>Internal Sovereignty:</strong> Implies state power final source of all laws internally. No other authority may claim equality.</li>
               <li><strong>External Sovereignty:</strong> Implies state should be free from foreign control. State willingly accepts international obligations in membership (e.g., UN).</li>
           </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
           Existence of sovereign authority appears in law. Law binding on all. Universally accepted sovereign state legally competent to issue any command binding citizens/associations.
        </p>
       </div>

       <!-- Slide 11: Features of State: Recognition (Contemporary) -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Features of State: Recognition (Contemporary)</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            In addition to 1933 features, contemporary theorists and UN consider <strong>recognition</strong> as fifth essential attribute. For political unit to be accepted as state with 'international personality', must be recognized as such by significant portion of international stage (other states, international/non-governmental organizations).
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Recognition implies both approaching necessary facts and desire to come into effect of legal/political results. Likewise, for government to be formally recognized as legitimate government, must be recognized by other governments.
          </p>

        <div class="activity-box">
          <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700">Brainstorming:</p>
          <p class="italic text-gray-600">What is the nature of state power, and whose interests does the state represent?</p>
        </div>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mt-6 mb-4">
            Various rival theories offer different accounts of origins, development, impact. Intense controversy about nature of state power; goes to heart of ideological/theoretical disagreements.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Relate to questions like: Is state autonomous/independent? Essentially product of society? Reflection of broader distribution of power? Does state serve common/collective good, or biased favoring privileged groups? Similarly, is state positive/constructive force, or negative/destructive?
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Andrew Heywood (2013) classified rival theories into four: pluralist, capitalist, leviathan, patriarchal.
          </p>
       </div>

        <!-- Slide 13: Pluralist State -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">4.4.1 The Pluralist State</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Clear liberal lineage. Stems from belief state acts as 'umpire' or 'referee' in society. View dominated mainstream political analysis, especially Anglo-American thought. Uncommon in tradition for state to be dismissed as abstraction; courts, civil service, military seen as independent actors.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Approach possible based on underlying, often unacknowledged, assumptions about state neutrality. State seen as <strong>impartial arbiter</strong> or referee that can be bent to will of government.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Origins traced to social-contract theories (Hobbes, Locke). Principal concern: grounds of political obligation, grounds individual obliged to obey/respect state. Argued state arisen out of voluntary agreement (<strong>social contract</strong>) by individuals recognizing only establishment of sovereign power could safeguard them from insecurity/disorder/brutality of 'state of nature'.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
             As Locke put it, where there is no law there is no freedom.
           </p>
       </div>

      <!-- Slide 14: Pluralist State (Continued) -->
      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">The Pluralist State (Continued)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Liberal theory sees state as neutral arbiter among competing groups/individuals; 'umpire' protecting each citizen from encroachments of others. Neutrality reflects fact state acts in interests of all citizens, therefore represents common good/public interest.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Hobbes' view: stability/order secured only through absolute/unlimited state, power not challenged. Locke: developed more typical liberal defense of limited state. State specific: restricted to defense of 'natural' rights (life, liberty, property). Clear distinction between state responsibilities (domestic order, property enforcement) and individual responsibilities (realm of civil society). Locke believed citizens enjoy protection against state, which could be delivered via constitutional/representative government.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">
           Ideas developed into pluralist theory of state in 20th century. Pluralism asserts power widely/evenly dispersed. State neutral, insusceptible to influence of particular groups/interests. Not biased, doesn't have own interests. State 'servant of society'. As Schwarzmantel (1994) put it, state 'the state is the servant of society and not its master'.
         </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Slide 15: Pluralist State (Neo-Pluralism) -->
      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">The Pluralist State (Neo-Pluralism)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           State can be portrayed as 'pincushion' passively absorbing pressures exerted upon it. Two key assumptions:
           <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1">
             <li>State effectively subordinate to government. Non-elected bodies (civil service, judiciary, police, military) strictly impartial, subject to authority of political masters. State apparatus therefore thought to conform to principles of public service/political accountability.</li>
             <li>Democratic process meaningful/effective. Party competition/interest-group activity ensure government sensitive/responsive to public opinion. State like 'weather vane' blown whichever direction public-at-large dictates.</li>
           </ol>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Modern pluralists adopted more critical view: <strong>neo-pluralist</strong> theory (Dahl, Lindblom). Acknowledge modern industrialized states more complex/less responsive than classical pluralism suggested. Neo-pluralists, for instance, acknowledge business enjoys 'privileged position' influencing government.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
           Politics and Markets (Lindblom, 1980): major investor/employer in society, business bound to exercise sway over any government, whatever its ideological leanings. Neo-pluralists accept state *can* forge own sectional interests. This elite (senior civil servants, judges, police chiefs, military leaders) may pursue bureaucratic interests (state growth) or interests of client groups. State regarded as political actor in own right, viewed as powerful interest group. Encouraged Eric Nordlinger (1981) to develop state-centered model based on 'the autonomy of the democratic state'.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Slide 16: Capitalist State -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">4.4.2 The Capitalist State</h2>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Marxist notion offers clear alternative to pluralist image of state as neutral arbiter/umpire. Marxists argue state cannot be understood separately from economic structure of society. View usually understood in terms of classic formulation: state nothing but instrument of class oppression; state emerges out of, and reflects, class system.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Rich debate within Marxism moved theory beyond this classic formulation. Scope to revise Marxist attitudes stems from ambiguities in Marx's own writings.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
             Marx did not develop systematic theory. General sense: state part of 'superstructure' determined/conditioned by economic 'base' (real foundation of social life). Precise relationship unclear. Two theories identifiable in Marx's writings:
             <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1">
               <li>State dependent on society, entirely dependent on economically dominant class. (Communist Manifesto, 1848: 'executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie'). Capitalism is bourgeoisie; state starkly instrument for oppression of exploited class.</li>
               <li>More complex/subtle theory (e.g., analysis of revolutionary events 1848-51, Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte 1852): state could enjoy 'relative autonomy' from class system, capable of imposing will upon society, acting as 'appalling parasitic body'. Theory of state articulating interests of *any* class, not just bourgeoisie, but those of most populous class in French society, the smallholding peasantry. Did not develop this view in detail; autonomy relative, appears to mediate conflicting classes, maintains class system itself.</li>
             </ol>
          </p>
       </div>

      <!-- Slide 17: Capitalist State (Continued) -->
      <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">The Capitalist State (Continued)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Both theories differ markedly from liberal/pluralist models. Emphasize state cannot be understood except in context of unequal class power, arising out of, and reflecting, capitalist society. Either instrument of oppression wielded by dominant class, or (more subtly) mechanism through which class antagonisms ameliorated. Nevertheless, Marx's attitude towards state not entirely negative; argued could be used constructively during transition from capitalism to communism ('revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat').
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Overthrow of capitalism would see destruction of bourgeois state, creation of alternative, proletarian one.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">
           Describing state as proletarian 'dictatorship', Marx utilized first theory: state as instrument through which economically dominant class (proletariat) could repress/subdue other classes. All states, from this perspective, class dictatorships. 'Dictatorship of proletariat' seen as means of safeguarding gains of revolution counter-revolution mounted by dispossessed bourgeoisie. Predicted as class antagonisms faded, state would 'wither away', resulting communist society would be stateless.
         </p>
       </div>

      <!-- Slide 18: Capitalist State (Neo-Marxism) -->
       <div class="slide">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">The Capitalist State (Neo-Marxism)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Since state emerged out of class system, once class system abolished, state loses reason for existence. Marx's ambivalent heritage provided modern Marxists/neo-Marxists considerable scope. Encouraged by writings of Antonio Gramsci, who emphasized degree to which ruling class domination achieved by ideological manipulation ('hegemony') rather than just open coercion. Bourgeois domination maintained largely through 'hegemony': intellectual leadership/cultural control, state playing important role.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           Since 1960s, Marxist theorizing dominated by rival instrumentalist and structuralist views.
           <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>Instrumentalist (Miliband, 1969):</strong> State agent/instrument of ruling class. Extent state elite disproportionately drawn from privileged backgrounds emphasized. Bias derived from overlap of social backgrounds between state officials and elites in business, finance, etc.</li>
               <li><strong>Structuralist (Poulantzas, 1968):</strong> Dismissed sociological approach. Argued state cannot but act to perpetuate social system (capitalism). Structure of economic/social power exerts constraint on state autonomy.</li>
           </ul>
            In capitalist state, role is to serve long-term interests of capitalism, even if actions resisted by sections of capitalist class itself. Neo-Marxists see state as terrain on which struggle amongst interests, groups, classes conducted. Rather than instrument, state itself struggle.

            Image of state as 'leviathan' (in effect, self-serving monster intent on expansion/aggrandizement) associated with New Right. Rooted in early/classical liberalism, particularly commitment to radical individualism.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            New Right, or at least neoliberal wing, distinguished by strong antipathy towards state intervention in economic/social life. Born out of belief state is parasitic growth threatening individual liberty/economic security. Instead of impartial umpire/arbiter, state seen as overbearing 'nanny', desperate to interfere/meddle. Central feature: state pursues interests separate from society (setting it apart from Marxism), interests demand unrelenting growth in role/responsibilities.
         </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
             New Right thinkers argue 20th-century tendency towards state intervention reflected popular pressure for economic/social security, need to stabilize capitalism against class tensions, internal dynamics of state apparatus. Explain expansionist dynamics by reference to demand-side and supply-side pressures.
             <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Demand-side:</strong> Emanate from society itself, usually through electoral democracy mechanism. Argument: electoral competition encourages politicians to 'outbid' one another making promises of increased spending/government programs, regardless of long-term damage (higher taxes, inflation, 'crowding out' investment).</li>
                 <li><strong>Supply-side:</strong> Internal to state apparatus. Explained in terms of institutions/personnel of state apparatus. Most influential: argument government oversupply thesis. Associated with public-choice theorists examining how public decisions made based on assumption individuals act rationally, self-interestedly. Bureaucratic self-interest invariably supports 'big' government/state intervention (enlarges bureaucracy itself, job security, pay, promotion prospects, status). Image of self-seeking bureaucrats at odds with pluralist notion of state machine imbued with ethic of public service subject to political control.</li>

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Modern thinking about state must take account of feminist theory implications. Not to say there is single feminist theory; encompasses range of traditions, differing views towards state power.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Feminists usually not regarded nature of state power as central political issue, preferring focus on deeper structure of male power centered on institutions like family/economic system. Some feminists question conventional definitions of state, arguing idea state exercises monopoly of legitimate violence compromised by routine use of violence/intimidation in family/domestic life. Implicitly/explicitly, feminists helped enrich state debate developing novel/challenging perspectives.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             <strong>Liberal feminists:</strong> Believe sexual/gender equality brought about through incremental reform; accept essentially pluralist view of state. Recognize if women denied legal/political equality (esp. right to vote), state biased in favor of men. Faith in state's basic neutrality reflected in belief any bias can/will be overcome by process of reform. Sense state can be used impartially to promote justice/common good. Often view state positively, seeing intervention as means of redressing gender inequality/enhancing role of women. Campaigns for equal-pay legislation, abortion legality, provision of child-care facilities, extension of welfare benefits.

            Nevertheless, more critical/negative view developed by <strong>radical feminists</strong>, arguing state power reflects deeper structure of oppression in society at large (patriarchy). Parallels Marxist view of state power: both groups deny state autonomous entity bent on pursuit of own interests. Instead, state understood/its biases explained by reference to 'deep structure' of power in society at large.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Where Marxists place state in economic context, radical feminists place it in context of gender inequality; insist state essentially institution of male power.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Common with Marxism, distinctive instrumentalist and structuralist versions of feminist power developed:
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
               <li><strong>Instrumentalist:</strong> Views state as little more than agent/'tool' used by men to defend interests/uphold structures of patriarchy. Line of argument draws on core feminist belief patriarchy rooted in division of society into distinct 'public' and 'private' spheres of life, men dominating former while women confined to latter. Quite simply, state run by men, for men.</li>
                <li><strong>Structuralist:</strong> Arguments focus on personnel of state (particularly state elite), emphasize degree state institutions embedded in wider patriarchal system. Modern radical feminists paid particular attention to emergence of welfare state, seeing it as expression of new kind of patriarchal power. Welfare upholds patriarchy bringing transition from private dependence (women as 'home makers' dependent on men as 'breadwinners') to public dependence increasingly controlled by institutions of extended state. Women have become clients or customers of state services (childcare, nursery education, social work) and employees, particularly in 'caring' professions (nursing, social work, education).</li>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-6 mb-4">
           Contrasting interpretations have clear implications for desirable role/responsibilities. With exception of anarchists (dismiss state as fundamentally evil/unnecessary), all political thinkers regarded state as, in some sense, worthwhile. Even revolutionary socialists (inspired by Leninist slogan 'smash the state') accept need for temporary proletarian state to preside over transition from capitalism to communism ('dictatorship of the proletariat').
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">
           Nevertheless, profound disagreement about exact role state should play, proper balance between state and civil society. Different forms state systems developed:

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">4.5.1 Minimal States</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Ideal of classical liberals, aim to ensure individuals enjoy widest possible realm of freedom. Rooted in social-contract theory, but advances essentially 'negative' view of state. Value of state: capacity to constrain human behavior, prevent encroaching on rights/liberties of others. State merely protective body; core function provide framework of peace/social order.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           In Locke's view, state acts as 'night watchman' whose services needed only when orderly existence threatened. This implies state 'minimal' or 'night watchman' state with three core functions:
           <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1">
             <li>Maintain domestic order.</li>
             <li>Ensure contracts/voluntary agreements made between private citizens enforced.</li>
             <li>Provide protection against external attack.</li>
           </ol>
           Institutional apparatus thus limited to police force, court system, military. Economic, social, cultural, moral responsibilities belong to individual, are therefore part of civil society.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">
           Cause of minimal state taken up by New Right. Drawing on early liberal ideas, particularly free-market economic theories, they proclaimed need to 'roll back the frontiers of the state'.

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           In writings of Robert Nozick (1974), amounts to restatement of Lockean liberalism based on defense of individual rights, especially property rights. In case of free-market economists like Friedrich von Haye and Milton Friedman, state intervention seen as 'dead hand' reducing competition/efficiency/productivity. Economic role confined to two functions: maintenance of stable means of exchange ('sound money' - low/zero inflation) and promotion of competition (controls on monopoly power, price fixing).
         </p>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6 text-gray-700">4.5.2 Developmental States</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Best historical examples minimal states were UK/USA during early industrialization. As general rule, later country industrializes, more extensive its state's economic role. In Japan/Germany, state assumed more active 'developmental' role.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
             Developmental state intervenes in economic life with specific purpose of promoting industrial growth/economic development. Does not amount to socialist system of planning/control but, rather, attempt to construct partnership between state and major economic interests, often underpinned by conservative/nationalist priorities. Classic example: Japan. During Meiji Period (1868–1912), state forged close relationship with Zaibatsu (great family-run business empires) that dominated economy up until WWII. Since 1945, developmental role assumed by Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), which, together with Bank of Japan, helps shape private investment decisions/steer Japanese economy towards international competitiveness. Similar model existed in France, where governments (left/right) recognized need for economic planning, state bureaucracy custodian of national interest. Austria/Germany economic development achieved through 'partnership state', emphasis on close relationship between state/major economic interests (notably big business/organized labor).

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            More recently, economic globalization fostered emergence of 'competition states', examples found amongst tiger economies of East Asia. Competition states distinguished by recognition need to strengthen education/training as principal guarantee of economic success in context of intensifying transnational competition.

         <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6 text-gray-700">4.5.3 Social Democratic (Welfare) States</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
             Whereas developmental states practice interventionism to stimulate economic progress, social-democratic states intervene with view to bringing about broader social restructuring, usually in accordance with principles like fairness, equality, social justice. Countries like Austria/Sweden, state intervention guided by developmental/social democratic priorities. Nevertheless, developmentalism/social democracy do not always go hand-in-hand. As Marquand (1988) pointed out, UK state significantly extended in period immediately after WWII along social-democratic lines, failed to evolve into developmental state. Key to understanding: shift from 'negative' view (state as little more than necessary evil) to positive view (state means of enlarging liberty/promoting justice). Social-democratic state thus ideal of both modern liberals/democratic socialists.
          </p>
           <p class="text-gray-600">
             Rather than merely laying down conditions of orderly existence, social-democratic state active participant, helping rectify imbalances/injustices of market economy. Tends focus less upon generation of wealth, more upon what is seen as equitable/just distribution. Aims attempt to eradicate poverty/reduce social inequality. Twin features: Keynesianism and social welfare. Aim of Keynesian economic policies 'manage'/'regulate' capitalism promoting growth/maintaining full employment. Although may entail element of planning, classic Keynesian strategy involves 'demand management' through adjustments in fiscal policy (levels of public spending/taxation). Adoption of welfare policies led to emergence of 'welfare states', responsibilities extended to promotion of social well-being amongst citizens. State 'enabling state', dedicated to principle of individual empowerment.

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            While developmental/social-democratic states intervene in economic life view guiding/supporting largely private economy, collectivized states bring entirety of economic life under state control. Best examples orthodox communist countries like USSR/throughout Eastern Europe. Sought abolish private enterprise altogether, set up centrally planned economies administered by network of economic ministries/planning committees ('command economies'). Justification stems from fundamental socialist preference for common ownership over private property. However, use of state to attain this goal suggests more positive attitude towards state power than outlined in classical writings of Marx/Engels.
         </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600">
            Marx/Engels by no means ruled out nationalization; Engels recognized state control extended to include factories, banks, transportation. Nevertheless, envisaged proletarian state strictly temporary, would 'wither away' as class antagonisms abated. In contrast, collectivized state USSR became permanent, increasingly powerful/bureaucratic. Under Stalin, effectively equated with statism, advance of socialism reflected in widening responsibilities/powers of state apparatus. Indeed, after Khrushchev announced 1962 dictatorship of proletariat ended, state was formally identified with interests of 'the whole Soviet peoples'.

         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Most extreme/extensive form of interventionism found in totalitarian states. Essence construction of all-embracing state, influence penetrates every aspect of human existence. State brings not only economy, but also education, culture, religion, family life under direct state control. Best examples Hitler's Germany/Stalin's USSR, although modern regimes like Saddam Hussein's Iraq arguably similar. Central pillars comprehensive process of surveillance/terroristic policing, pervasive system of ideological manipulation/control.
         </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
             In this sense, totalitarian states effectively extinguish civil society, abolish private sphere altogether. Goal only fascists, who wish dissolve individual identity within social whole, prepared openly endorse. Sometimes argued Mussolini's notion of totalitarian state derived from Hegel's belief state as 'ethical community' reflecting altruism/mutual sympathy of members. From this perspective, advance of human civilization linked to aggrandizement of state, widening responsibilities.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
           On face of it, religious state contradiction in terms. Modern state emerged largely through separation between church and state. Advance of state sovereignty thus usually went hand in hand with forward march of secularization. In USA, secular nature enshrined in First Amendment; in France separation guaranteed freedom of worship shall not be abridged, while principle of *laïcité* maintained strict emphasis on separation. In countries like Norway, Denmark, UK, 'established' or state religions developed, although privileges generally enjoy stop well short of theocratic rule, political influence generally restricted by high level level of social secularization.
        </p>
         <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Nevertheless, period since 1980s witnessed rise of religious state, driven by tendency within religious fundamentalism reject public/private divide view religion as basis of politics. Far from regarding political realm as inherently corrupt, fundamentalist movements typically look seize control of state use it as instrument of moral/spiritual regeneration. Was evident, for instance, in process 'Islamization' introduced Pakistan under General Zia-ul-Haq after 1978, establishment 'Islamic state' Iran result of 1979 revolution. Close links between Sri Lankan state/Sinhala Buddhism, particularly during years violent struggle against Tamil separatism.

          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Although strictly speaking, religious states founded on basis of religious principles, and, in Iranian model, contain explicitly theocratic features, in other cases religiously-oriented governments operate context of constitutional secularism.

           Broadest sense, government means to rule or control others. Can therefore be taken to include any mechanism through which ordered rule is maintained, its central features being ability make collective decisions and capacity enforce them. A form of government identified in almost all social institutions like families, schools, businesses, trade unions and so on. However, government in our context refers to formal/institutional processes that operate at national level maintain public order/facilitate collective action. It is body or organ that administers country/main organization dealing affairs of whole country. Thus, government one of most essential components, also administrative wing of state.

         <p class="text-gray-600">
            In other words, government can also refer political organization comprising individuals/institutions authorized formulate public policies/conduct affairs of state. Governments empowered establish/regulate interrelationships of people within territorial confines, relations community whole, dealings of community other political entities. Government applies both national states (federal government Ethiopia/governments subdivisions like regional states, provinces, municipalities) and international states. Any form of government, to be stable/effective, must possess two essential attributes: authority/legitimacy.

           In politics, word authority implies ability compel obedience. Can simply be defined as 'legitimate power.' While power ability influence behavior, authority is right to do so. Therefore, based on acknowledged duty obey rather than coercion/manipulation. Thus, authority legitimacy, justification/right exercise that power. Authority can be expressed naked force/terror as case undemocratic governments or through series more transparent public hearings most democratic states.

          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Term legitimacy (from Latin *legitimare*, 'to declare lawful') broadly means rightfulness. Attribute of government prompts governed comply willingly its authority. Confers on order/commands authoritative or binding character, thus transforming power into authority. Legitimacy popular acceptance of governing regime/law as authority.

           <p class="text-gray-600">
             Considered basic condition rule; without at least minimal amount legitimacy, government deadlocks/collapses. As long as legitimacy stays certain level, stability maintained, fails below this level endangered. For most regimes seen requiring large proportion population retain power, but not necessarily case, since many unpopular regimes known survive provided they seen legitimate within small but influential elite. Therefore, legitimacy gained through acquisition power accordance recognized/accepted standards or principles. That say legitimate government 'do the right thing' therefore deserves be respected/obeyed. Concept legitimacy differs from legality in sense term legality does not necessarily guarantee government respected citizens acknowledge duty obedience.

            One central question political philosophy purpose government. Many great political philosophers conceived themselves with this question. One common formulation: main purpose state protect rights/preserve justice. Several ways conceive differences between different political views. For example, one might ask areas should government have jurisdiction, to what extent intervene those areas, or even what constitutes intervention in first place. A lot of institutions can be said exist only because government provides framework their existence; for instance, Marxist argue institution private property only exists due government. Mostly, constitutions various countries codify views purposes, powers, forms governments, but they tend do so rather vague terms, which particular laws, courts, actions politicians subsequently flesh out.

For this reason, citizenship polysemy term which had different meanings depending historical legacies, political organization state, ideologies/socio-cultural context societies.

           Mere fact being citizen makes person creditor series rights. In sense, current political discourse often tends identify citizenship with rights. Marshall 1998, distinguishes three types rights historically been established succession:
           <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
             <li><strong>Civil Rights:</strong> Necessary for development individual liberty; political, i.e. right participate exercise political power, elected member/voter; social rights, those guarantee right public safety, health, education, etc., that right decent life.</li>

            These rights precise status citizens, enjoy these means full member democratic society. Each right often pursued specific institutional forums: legal/civil rights mainly exercised courts; political rights used voting booths, legislatures/street protests; social rights often activated/disputed government buildings.

           Oldfield (1990), Mouffe (1992), Lister (1997) conceptualize citizenship both status/active practice. Citizenship status accords range rights/obligations. That why; Jones Gaventa (2002) assert that rights obligations lie heart language citizenship. Hence, legally/sociologically speaking, citizen person who has privilege enjoy citizenship rights essential agency. Hohfeld (1978), for instance, discovered four components rights known 'The Hohfeldian incidents' namely, liberty (privilege), claim, power immunity.

           <li>
             <strong>Liberty Right:</strong> Freedom given right-holder do something there are no obligations other parties do anything enjoy such rights. Beholder got benefits from liberty rights without obliging others. Furthermore, no one including State has legitimate authority interfere citizen's freedom except prevent harm others. For instance, every citizen has right movement. His/her right movement goes level where another's claim right limits his/her freedom (see articles 25-34 FDRE constitution). But what does mean claim rights?
           </li>
           <li>
             <strong>Claim Rights:</strong> Inverse liberty rights since entails responsibility upon another person or body. Duty bearer has accomplish something indispensable right holders enjoy claim rights. Must be somebody who do refrain from doing something to/for claim holder, i.e., claim rights enjoyed individuals when others discharge their obligations. Hence, contrast liberty rights, claim rights impose corresponding duty others help respect protect bearers. For instance, social rights such unemployment/public service benefits claims directly depend taxes paid others. mention, contract between employer/employee confers employee right paid his/her wages. Employee has claim employer has duty pay employee wages. Article 41(3&4) FDRE constitution underlines responsibility government avail publicly funded social services such health/education since all Ethiopian citizens have right enjoy such basic privileges, claim rights. Liberty claim rights termed primary rules, rules requiring people perform refrain from doing particular action. There two other rights termed secondary rules, according Hohfeldian incidents. These secondary rules specify how agents/beholders introduce, change alter primary rules (liberty claim rights).
           </li>
           <li>
             <strong>Powers Rights:</strong> Rights regarding modification first-order rights. They cooperative controls imposed others. Holder power, be it government citizen, can change cancel other people his/her own entitlements. For example, Article 40(1) FDRE constitution asserts Ethiopian citizens have rights ownership private property modify, sale, donate transfer property third party. As stated Article 33(3) FDRE constitution, every Ethiopian citizen has right renounce his/her Ethiopian citizenship/nationality which shows power rights citizens. Similarly, government has also power modify legal rights through imposing removing duties from citizens.
           </li>
           <li>
              <strong>Immunity Rights:</strong> Allow bearers escape from controls thus they opposite power rights. Immunity rights entail absence power other party alter right-holder's normative situation some way. For instance, civil servants have right not dismissed from their job after new government comes power. Witness court has right not ordered incriminate himself/herself. Additionally, as affirmed Article 18(3) FDRE constitution, “no one shall be required perform forced compulsory labour”. Immunities also comprise compensation rights violations occurred past at least partially make up for past injustices uneven burdens.

Since citizens are embodied with social relations, “to act as citizen requires sense agency: belief that one can act; acting citizen, especially collectively” (Lister, 1998: 38). Therefore, framing citizenship as agency place undue obligation people consciously exercise citizenship rights. For example, involvement service users decision-making process public services helps them consider themselves active agents making creating services they receive rather than being passive beneficiaries.

Additionally, there are also responsibilities shared both non-citizens citizens domiciled Ethiopia respecting laws country. However, citizens fundamentally different from aliens enjoying privileges shouldering responsibilities. There some political economic rights reserved duties discharged citizens only. For instance, Ethiopian citizen has right get access land, vote be elected get Ethiopian passport. Likewise, defending constitution well Ethiopia territory from foreign aggressors solely duty Ethiopian citizens. Generally, citizenship legal relationship between person State different from specific legal relation exist between foreigners host State.

John Locke (1960), one among influential early expositors liberal theory, viewed individuals endowed with reasoning skills, through which they can discern act upon dictates divinely given natural law. If individuals act irrationally, means they debase their natural faculties misapprehend what natural law requires. Locke argued natural law reason apprehend compel individuals consider their own others interests, enter civil political society, act community thus value social cooperation self-restraint. Thus, individual morally prior community: community matters only because contributes well-being individuals who compose it. If those individuals no longer find worthwhile maintaining existing cultural practices, then community has independent interest preserving those practices, no right prevent individuals from modifying rejecting them.

            Likewise, liberals deem internal factors primary reasons determine personal identity. They provide little consideration environmental factors process shaping self. Beyond this, liberalists claims individual person shapes all other social aggregations, including state. Therefore, citizenship other political institutions given State means that accepted only conditionally – i.e., long as they, individual's calculations, foster maximization citizen's preferences/benefits. John Stuart Mill, for instance, regarded individuality self-interest as source social, not just personal, progress well-being.

It follows individuals have right choose level participation community order fulfill maximize their own self-interest. If they choose not do so, their citizenship not jeopardized. Where others' interests affected, however, State may be justified regulating activity. Are three fundamental principles which liberal government must provide protect: (1) equality, whereby government has treat individuals who similarly situated same way afford them same rights; (2) due process, such government required treat individuals over whom exercises power fairly; (3) mutual consent which membership political community rests on consensual relationship between individual state.

Common positive liberty accounts claim State should act affirmatively create secure those substantive entitlements (e.g. income, health care, education) individuals need order lead dignified, independent lives essential their freedom. However, freedom under government, John Lock (1960 cited Schuck, 2002: 133) has already described it, embraces living conformity predictable, non-arbitrary law which one has directly indirectly consented.

            Generally, bedrock principles liberal theory citizenship are: individuals free form their own opinions, pursue their own projects, transact their own business untrammeled State's political agenda coercive power, except far as individual actions implicate interests other members society. Liberal citizens thus left their own devices without much guidance from state. They must decide for themselves how use their constitutionally secured freedoms, decide what kind citizen be – including possibility they will decide forswear any political activity at all, preferring retreat entirely private world family, friends, market transactions, self-absorption, into world largely indifferent any public goods not generated within these parochial domains. Citizenship cannot defined based shared identity common culture; individual chooses his own affections, any identification with other individuals rather product their legal status citizens. Equal rights bind citizens together legal community free individuals. This does not imply complete rejection culture identity as such, but identity culture not *a priori* foundations citizenship.

Most common problems related advocating individualism free-riders problem tragedy commons. The free riders problem occurs those who benefit from resource service do not pay for it, which results under provision resource/service. Particularly it occurs when property rights not clearly defined imposed. Whereas, tragedy commons dilemma arises when individuals act independently rationally consulting their own self-interest ultimately deplete shared limited environmental resources. Since no one owns commons, e.g. atmosphere grazing lands, each individual has incentive utilize common resources much possible they can. Consequently, environmental pressures humanitarian emergencies pose great challenges liberal States, demanding larger State role allocating scarce resources, rights statuses among competing interests often bearing compelling moral claims. Action protect environment involves international agreements collectively reduce emissions regulate other activities. These sorts agreements involve giving up short-term advantages long-term common benefit designed prevent any one them free-riding actions others – for example, continuing pollute while other countries cut their emissions, thereby reaping environmental advantages without paying any costs.

Needless say, liberal thought facilitate pursuit wealth indulgence material pleasures thus matter fact preference, liberal societies tend be less egalitarian.

Perhaps most daunting challenge liberalism, then, reduce inequalities socially acceptable politically sustainable from views disadvantaged groups, while same time vindicating liberal commitment protection individual liberties. For several reasons, however, liberalism may actually increase economic other kinds inequalities rather than reduce them. The persistence inequalities among liberal citizens between them aliens bound engender much social political unrest tensions, unless until benefits market-driven economic growth 'trickle down' socially disadvantaged. Structurally, well ideologically, liberal states make redistributive policies difficult enact, implement, legitimate. In liberal social system, private sector controls most incentive systems that drive shape individual group behavior; these systems largely immune from State control. More fundamentally, liberalism contrives keep State weak permeable private interests, institutionalizing its endemic fear state power through political structures practices widely disperse confine state's influence. Finally, liberalism posits State maintains substantial normative neutrality. In this conception, liberal State should neither choose among competing visions good society nor place its thumb scales other ways, such redistributive policies, that favor particular visions. It should instead play far more modest, supplementing role, facilitating individuals' pursuit their own projects visions. The issues how liberal State's role remains modest become matter great controversy course history has proved impossibility State maintain neutral.

            Republican citizenship theory put emphasis both individual group rights. Means republican though attempts incorporate liberal notion self-interested individual within communitarian framework egalitarian community belonging. Like communitarian thought, citizens together particular community. Citizenship should understood common civic identity, shaped common public culture. It requires citizens bring together facets their individual lives best they can helps them find unity midst diversity. However, republicans don't pressurize individuals surrender their particular identities like communitarian thought. Instead, underpinned by common individual obligation participate communal affairs. It attempts look for common ground between toleration dispute their differences, citizens. At this juncture, effective balance between toleration obligation required. Toleration involves citizens participating politically advocates particular interests, with their concern focused 'fairness between different sections community pursuit common ends.

            Just like liberal though, republican school advocate self-government. Yet, republican thought do not agree with case that all forms restraints deprive people's freedom. Liberalism, as we have already discussed, advocates absolute freedom individuals gives insignificant consideration towards nurturing public virtues that lead people do their duties citizens. In contrast republicanism, individuals must overcome restraints inclinations set aside their private interests when necessary do what best for public. Republicans, thus, acknowledge value public life. To them, public life draws out talents capacities, draws them together into community – into connection solidarity, occasionally conflict, with other members public.

            However, without citizens who willing take active part government, republic State could not survive. True citizenship requires commitment common good active participation public affairs – civic virtue. Republics must thus engage what Sandel (1996: 6) calls “a formative politics... that cultivates citizens qualities character that self-government requires”. Constitutional safeguards may necessary resist corruption forms avarice, ambition, luxury, idleness, but they will not suffice sustain freedom under rule law absent significant degree virtue among citizens. To say that 'Amare' citizen republican State, means enjoyed protection State's laws subject laws. It also say that, citizen, 'Amare' supposed be equal footing with other citizens. The rule law thus requires not only active public-spirited participation public affairs – civic virtue republican citizen – also proper form government.

The Internet satellite television unlikely inspire this sense community global basis. The second criticism that conception poses threat open, egalitarian, pluralistic society. This second criticism put forcefully Young (1990: 117), who detects denial 'difference' republican attempts because practice republican politicians enforced homogeneity excluding from citizenship all those defined different. To be sure, Young's point that search common ground serves justify dominance particular – typically male – group. The third point concerns claim identifies false ideal impartiality. Here, republican response deny that ideal false. We should indeed strive think act, when establishing laws policies, members public rather than self-interested individuals.

Treating people equally, despite fact past actions have made them unequal, can perpetuate inequality. Government should take measures combat barriers based gender, sexual preference, age, disability, location, Aboriginality, ethnicity, religion, area origin culture (Castles, 1999: iii). In this view, multicultural citizenship allows marginalized voices heard. A differentiated conception citizenship needed help marginalized groups attain civic equality recognition multicultural democratic nations. Society formed different groups which either dominant oppressed (Young, 1989). This strand differentiated citizenship therefore concerns denouncing universal rights provision special rights oppressed groups.
